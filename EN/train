their O
most O
expensive O

when O

But O
who O
says O
Murray's O
is O
anything O
about O
service B-negative
. O

The O
atmosphere O
was O
mostly O
of O
an O
older O
crowd O
, O
but O
there O
were O
a O
few O
groups O
of O
mid O
20 O
' O

30 O
year O
olds O
also O
. O

Just O
straight O
up O
cheap O
, O
good O
food B-positive
. O

The O
service B-negative
was O
terrible O
, O
we O
had O
to O
wait O
for O
everything O
and O
ask O
several O
of O
different O
people O
for O
the O
same O
thing O
before O
we O
were O
allowed O
to O
be O
served O

This O
is O
a O
great O
place O
to O
get O
a O
delicious O

Um O

agree O
that O
dining O
at O
Casa B-negative
La I-negative
Femme I-negative
is O
like O
no O
other O
dining O
experience O
! O

It O
wasn't O
the O
freshest O
seafood B-neutral
ever O
, O
but O
the O
taste O
and O
presentation O
was O
OK O
. O

They O
have O
authentic O
Indian B-positive
at O
amazin O
prices O
. O

The O
food B-positive
was O
delicious O
( O
I O
had O
a O
halibut B-positive
special I-positive
, O
my O
husband O
had O
steak B-positive
) O
, O
and O
the O
service B-positive
was O
top-notch O

the O

is O
decent O
. O

i O
am O
never O
disappointed O
with O
there O
food B-positive
. O

everyone O
was O
cheerfully O
cooperative O

the O

boy I-positive
even O
spotted O
that O
my O
table O
was O

a O
stabilized O
it O
for O
me O
. O

– O
This O
place O
is O
famous O
for O
their O
breakfast B-positive
. O

When O
I O
got O
there O
I O
sat O
up O
stairs O
where O
the O
atmosphere B-positive
was O
cozy O
& O
the O
service B-negative
was O
horrible O
! O

It O
is O
set O
far O
from O
the O
small O
street O
it's O
on O
, O
and O
there O
is O
no O
traffic O
noise O

– O
Save O
yourself O
the O
waste O
of O
time O
& O
DO O
NOT O
visit O

Recommendations O
, O
of O

, O
are O
required O
! O

Also O
they O
were O
$ O
15 O
each O
! O

Two O
thumbs O
up O
! O

This O
guy O
refused O
to O
seat O
her O
and O
she O
left O
, O
followed O
shortly O
by O
the O
four O
of O
us O
, O
but O
not O
before O
I O
told O
him O
that O
in O
my O
40 O
years O
of O
world O
travel O
, O
including O
Paris O
, O
that O
I O
had O
never O
seen O
such O
a O
display O
of O
bad O
behavior O
by O
a O
frontman B-negative
in O
a O
restaurant O
. O

I O
really O
liked O
this O
place B-positive
. O

The O
filet B-positive
mignon I-positive

was O
superb O
! O

Lucky B-positive
Strike I-positive
is O
a O
great O
casual O
place O
to O
just O
grab O
a O

to O
eat O
. O

I O
have O
never O
been O
so O
disgusted O
by O
both O

So O
, O
if O
you're O
walking O
by O
and O
thinking O
about O
dining O
, O
you O
might O
want O
to O
see O
who's O
going O

first O
... O

Good O
for O

The O

common O
to O
most O
pizzaria's O
. O

service B-positive
is O
friendly O
, O
and O
never O
had O
a O
problem O
walking O
in O

getting O
a O

I O
can't O
remember O
the O
last O
time O
I O
had O
such O
gross O

New O

The O
only O

the O

very O
good O
, O
didn't O
much O
like O
the O

that O
came O
with O
, O
but O
the O
filet O
was O
so O
good O
, O
neither O

The O

also O
quite O
reasonable O
. O

I O
won't O
go O
back O
unless O
someone O

The O

The O

and O
the O

staff I-positive
has O
been O
perfect O
every O

Both O
times O
I O

The O
omlette B-positive
for I-positive
brunch I-positive
is O
great O
... O

The O
level O
of O
rudeness O
was O
preposterous O
. O

I'm O
still O
mad O
that O
i O
had O
to O
pay O
for O
lousy O
food B-negative

Love O
the O

wise O
. O

The O
atmosphere B-negative
was O
pretty O
nice O
but O
had O
a O
bit O
lacking O
, O
which O
it O
tries O
to O
make O
up O
for O
with O
a O
crazy O
scheme B-negative
of I-negative
mirrors I-negative
. O

The O
in-house B-positive
lady I-positive
DJ I-positive
on O
Saturday O
nights O
has O
outrageously O
good O
taste O
in O
music O
, O
and O

A O
pleasant O
surprise O

The O
food O
arrived O
in O
about O
15 O
minutes O

Their O
sake B-positive

All O
in O
all O
, O
this O
midtown O
gem O
instantly O
became O
one O
of O
my O
favorite O
sushi O
restaurants O
in O
the O
city O
. O

Not O
the O
typical O
NYC O
gimmick O
theme O
restaurant B-positive

I O
complete O
the O
total O
bagel O
experience O
by O
having O
it O
lightly O
toasted O

We O
had O
a O
very O
nice O
time O

My O

We O
live O

is O
a O

you O
definitely O
will O
leave O
feeling O
satisfied O
and O
full O
. O

So O
for O
the O
' O
after O
beach O
excursion O
' O
, O
we O
thought O
we O
would O
end O
the O
day O
on O
a O
high O
note O
and O
make O
the O
trip O
across O
the O
street O
from O
the O
beach O
to O
Park O
Chalet O
. O

The O
one O
on O
the O

much O
better O
than O
the O
one O
on O
the O
west O
side O

Nice O

I O
lived O

check O
this O
place O
out O

Our O

did O
not O
ever O
get O
any O
better O

I O
don O
’ O
t O
usually O
visit O
the O
same O
establishment O
more O
than O
once O
, O
what O
more O
twice O
, O
but O
I O
’ O
ll O
come O
to O
Zenkichi B-positive
anytime O
for O
a O
quiet O
, O
unhurried O
and O
memorable O

and O
yes O
Dal B-positive
Bukhara I-positive

Ciao O
Bella O

Food B-neutral
was O
good O
not O

another O

Even O
my O
Indian O
friend O
couldn't O
believe O
how O
good O
and O
tasty O
everything O
was O
. O

My O
friend O
devoured O
her O
chicken B-positive
and I-positive
mashed I-positive
potatos I-positive

The O

not O
exactly O
the O

but O
still O
pretty O
good O
. O

Terrible O
, O
terrible O

the O
salads B-positive
are O
delicious O
, O
both O
refreshing O

very O
spicy O

visiting O
the O
1st B-positive

the O
original O

This O
is O
one O

it O
is O

I O
was O
in O

overpriced O
. O

The O
waitress B-positive
was O
very O
patient O

The O

very O
attentive O
to O
all O
the O

. O

The O

Don't O
leave O
the O

Quite O
simply O
it's O
like O
stepping O
out O
of O
Manhattan O
and O
into O
a O
haven O
of O
tranquility O
. O

I O
was O
literally O
going O
to O

but O
instead O
, O
my O
boyfriend O
took O
the O

This O

Great O

So O
here O
we O
are O
, O
my O
wife O
, O
3 O

old O

I O
trying O
to O
pass O
the O

( O
where O
the O

Excellent O

Once O
we O

a O

despite O

wanted O
an O

we O
were O
pushed O
into O
a O

that O
was O
only O

I O
have O
to O
say O
I O
have O
never O
had O
a O
disapointing O
meal B-positive
here O

i O
would O
just O
ask O

At O
first O
glance O
this O
place O
seems O
a O
bit O
pricey O
for O
a O
hot O
dog O
joint O
, O
but O
at O
Bark B-negative
you O
don't O
just O
get O
your O
average O
hot B-positive
dog I-positive
. O

Admittedly O
some O
nights O
inside O
the O
restaurant B-negative
were O
rather O
warm O
, O
but O
the O
open B-positive
kitchen I-positive
is O
part O
of O
the O

We O
had O
a O
great O
time O
at O
the O
Jekyll B-positive

last O
night O

An O
awesome O
organic O

You O
can O
get O
a O
completely O
delish O

a O

times O
, O
it O
is O
probably O
still O
the O
best O
Indian O

around O

The O

Tiny O

just O
plain O

what O
it O

Our O

a O

The O

do O
not O
come O
here O
on O
a O
empty O

The O

the O

the O

– O
This O
is O
my O
" O
must O
bring O
out O
of O
town O
guests O
to O
" O
restaurant B-positive
and O
they O
always O
enjoy O
and O
rave O
about O
it O
. O

I O
didn't O
complain O
, O
I O
liked O
the O
atmosphere B-positive
so O
much O
. O

There O
is O
a O
downside O
if O
you're O
ordering O
in O
- O
- O
the O
delivery B-negative
guys I-negative
have O
MAJOR O
attitude O
. O

You O
cannot O
go O
wrong O
with O
this O
place B-positive

The O
food B-positive

delicious O

from O
the O
specials B-positive
to O
the O
regular B-positive
menu-fare I-positive
, O
the O
dishes B-positive
are O
never O
a O
disappointment O

However O
, O
if O
you O
want O
great O
food B-positive
at O
a O
great O
price O
and O
don't O
mind O
the O
decor B-neutral
, O
you O
can't O
beat O
this O

Being O
serious O
sushi O
lovers O
, O
we O
sat O
at O
the O
sushi O
bar O
to O
be O
closer O
to O
the O

Add O
to O
that O
great O
service B-positive
and O
great O
food B-positive
at O
a O
reasonable O
price O
and O
you O
have O
yourself O
the O
beginning O

I O

Hats O
off O
to O
the O
chef B-positive

My O
main O
concern O
was O
the O
sanity O
of O
the O
food B-negative
that O
was O
being O
sent O
out O
to O
myself O
and O
others O
, O
but O
I O
would O
be O
lying O
is O
I O
said O
that O
as O
someone O
who O
has O
worked O
in O
restaurants O
since O
the O
age O
of O
fifteen O
I O
was O
expecting O
at O
least O
a O
minimal O
effort O
on O
the O
part O
of O
the O
restaurant O
to O
amend O
the O
situation O
. O

Server B-positive
made O
several O
sake B-positive
suggestions O
which O
were O
very O
good O
. O

It's O
great O
to O
go O
for O
a O
quick O
lunch O
either O
alone O

We O
stood O
there O
for O
10 O
minutes O
while O
employees B-negative
walked O
back O

forth O
ignoring O
us O

For O
a O
restaurant B-positive
with O
such O
a O
good O
reputation O
and O
that O
is O
usually O
so O
packed O
, O
there O
was O
no O

for O
such O

customer B-negative

we O
were O
tired O

when O
we O
got O
to O
the O

then O
we O
sat O
down O
to O
begin O
ordering O
appetizers O

Judging O
from O
previous O
posts O
this O
used O
to O
be O
a O
good O
place B-negative
, O
but O
not O
any O
longer O
. O

All O
the O
staff B-positive

absolutely O
professional O

Our O

Worst O
Service B-positive
I O
Ever O
Had O

The O
pizza B-positive
is O
delicious O
and O
the O
proprietor B-positive
is O
one O
of O
the O
nicest O
in O
NYC O
. O

Yes O
, O
the O
place B-positive
is O
classy O
and O
beautiful O
, O
but O
they O
most O
certainly O
target O
the O
uber O
whealthy O
Not O
the O
common O
joe O
that O
wants O
to O
go O
all O
out O
every O
once O
in O
a O

Despite O
a O
slightly O
limited O

everything O
prepared O
is O
done O
to O
perfection O
, O
ultra O
fresh O
and O
a O
work O

Service B-neutral
is O
not O
exactly O
five O
star O
, O
but O
thats O
not O
really O
a O
big O
deal O
. O

The O
freshest O
, O
best O
variety O
, O
and O
the O
fastest O
delivery B-positive
. O

It O
is O
quite O
a O
spectacular O
scene B-positive
i'll O
give O
them O
that O
. O

Avoid O
this O
place B-negative
! O

By O
far O
, O
the O
best O
pizza B-positive
in O
Manhattan O
. O

Best O
of O
all O
is O
the O
warm O
vibe B-positive
, O
the O
owner B-positive
is O
super O
friendly O
and O
service B-positive
is O
fast O
. O

The O

friendly O
and O
the O

was O
ethic O
and O
colorful O

Probably O
would O
not O

The O

better O

worse O
, O
the O

tenders I-positive

with O
the O

the O

you O

What's O
the O
difference O
between O
the O
two O

– O
I O
decided O
to O

you O

The O
place B-negative

small O

intimate O
and O
you O
may O
feel O
a O
little O
crowded O
, O
but O
the O

it's O
great O

The O
place B-positive

Only O
complaint O
is O
the O
pricing--I O
believe O
it O
would O
be O
more O
reasonable O
to O
pay O
a O
dollar O
less O
on O
each O
item O

We O
visited O

On O
a O
recent O

our O
waiter B-negative
was O
extremely O
dismissive O

while O
no O
less O
than O
three O

waited O
hand-and-foot O
on O
a O

make O
it O
a O
point O
to O

I O
never O
used O

am O
lately O
experimenting O
with O
it O
a O
lot O
more O

am O
acquiring O
a O
better O

it O

Highly O
impressed O
from O
the O
decor B-positive
to O
the O
food B-positive
to O
the O
hospitality O
to O
the O
great O
night O
I O
had O
! O

I O
have O
been O
here O
, O
spent O
tons O
of O
money O
on O
a O
chef B-negative
special I-negative
dinner I-negative
and O
it O
was O
a O
major O
dissappointment O
. O

The O
service B-positive
is O
excellent O
, O
the O
decor B-positive
is O
great O
, O
and O
the O
food B-positive
is O
delicious O
and O
comes O
in O
large O
portions B-positive
. O

I O
asked O
for O
an O
open O
faced O
cheese O
sandwich O
and O
the O
manager B-negative
basically O
told O
me O
to O
take O
my O
business O
elsewhere O
! O

But O
if O
you're O
prepared O
to O
spend O
some O
$ O
and O
remember O
to O
ask O
if O
something O
they O
offer O
is O
complimentary O
, O
then O
this O
is O
the O
place B-negative
to O
go O
for O
Indian B-positive
food I-positive

With O
the O
great O
variety O
on O
the O
menu B-positive
, O
I O
eat O
here O
often O
and O
never O
get O
bored O
. O

Great O
seasonal B-positive

with O
a O
classy O
waterfront B-positive
setting I-positive

Great O
find O
in O
the O
West O
Village O
! O

I've O
been O
wanting O
to O
go O
to O
this O
place O
forever O
and O
finally O
got O
a O
table O
. O

We O
were O
offered O
water O
for O
the O
table O
but O
were O
not O
told O
the O
Voss B-negative
bottles I-negative
of I-negative
water I-negative
were O
$ O
8 O
a O
piece O
. O

The O
potato B-positive
balls I-positive
were O
not O
dry O
at O
all O
... O
in O
fact O
it O
was O
buttery O
. O

– O
After O
12 O
years O
in O
Seattle O
Ray's B-positive
rates O
as O
the O
place O
we O
always O
go O
back O
to O
. O

I O
did O
not O
try O
the O
caviar O
but O
I O
tried O
their O
salmon B-positive
and O
crab B-positive
salad I-positive
( O
they O
are O
all O
good O
) O

As O
many O
other O
reviewers O
noticed O
, O
your O
order O
is O
often O
slow O
to O
arrive O
- O
this O
is O
particularly O
true O
in O
the O
evening O
but O
is O
not O
a O
problem O
during O
lunch O
time O
. O

A O
brief O
conversation O
with O
the O
manager B-negative
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
meal O
was O
the O
greatest O
disappointment--to O
say O
we O
had O
been O
" O
blown O
off O
" O
would O
be O
an O
understatement O
. O

Sushi B-positive
experience O
was O
unbelievable O
with O
my O
fiance O
. O

The O
dessert O
( O
we O
had O
a O
pear B-positive
torte I-positive
) O
was O
good O
- O
but O
, O
once O
again O
, O
the O
staff B-negative
was O
unable O
to O
provide O
appropriate O
drink O
suggestions O
. O

It O
was O
served O
with O
skin O
, O
over O
a O
bed O
of O
extremely O
undercooked O
spinach B-negative
and O
mashed O
potatoes O
. O

Always O
a O
winner O
. O

Suan B-positive
is O
a O
great O
place O
that O
I O
often O
take O
my O
friends O
( O
classmates O
) O
too O
. O

Compared O
to O
other O
shabu O
restaurants O
around O
town O
, O
this O
places O
wins O
hands-down O
. O

Although O
the O
service B-negative
could O
be O
improved O
considering O
the O
money O
you O
put O
in O
. O

Service B-negative
was O
just O
ok O
, O
it O
is O
not O
what O
you'd O
expect O
for O
$ O
500 O
. O

They O
refuse O
to O
seat O
parties O
of O
3 O
or O
more O
on O
weekends O
. O

for O
desert O
we O
had O
the O
mango B-positive

creme I-positive
brulee I-positive
... O
oh O
la O
la O
yummy O
! O
! O
! O

This O
place O
has O
totally O
weird O
decor B-negative
, O
stairs O
going O
up O
with O
mirrored B-negative
walls I-negative
- O
I O
am O
surprised O
how O
no O
one O
yet O
broke O
their O
head O
or O
fall O
off O
the O
stairs O
- O
mirrored O
walls O
make O
you O
dizzy O
and O
delusional O
... O

I O
recently O
went O
to O
this O
restaurant B-positive
with O
some O
co-workers O
for O
lunch O
and O
had O
an O
amazing O
time O
. O

Regardless O
, O
we'll O
be O
back O
and O
can't O
wait O
to O
visit O
in O
the O
summer O
to O
take O
advantage O
of O
the O
patio B-positive
. O

Service B-negative
was O
slow O
, O
but O
the O
people B-positive
were O
friendly O
. O

The O
prices O
are O
outrageous O
, O
especially O
since O
the O
food O
was O
actually O
less O
satisfying O
than O
most O
neighborhood O
Chinese O
establishments O
. O

My O
friends O
and O
I O
were O
on O
vacation O
in O
NY O
and O
was O
referred O
to O
Chance O
by O
a O
friend O
. O

At O
best O
, O
the O
food B-neutral
was O
good O
and O
definately O
overpriced O
. O

Not O
what O
I O
would O
expect O
for O
the O
price O
and O
prestige O
of O
this O
location B-neutral
. O

But O
the O
service B-negative
is O
HORRID O
! O

However O
, O
the O
value O
and O
service B-negative
are O
both O
severely O
lacking O
. O

The O
tables B-negative
are O
crammed O
way O
too O
close O
, O
the O
menu B-neutral
is O
typical O
of O
any O
Italian O
restaurant O
, O
and O
the O
wine B-negative
list I-negative
is O
simply O
overpriced O
. O

i O
love O
this O
place B-positive
! O

The O
appetizers O
we O
ordered O
were O
served O
quickly O
- O
an O
order O
of O
fried B-positive
oysters I-positive
and I-positive
clams I-positive
were O
delicious O
but O
a O
tiny O
portion O
( O
maybe O
3 O
of O
each O
) O
. O

Price O
and O
quality O
of O
fish B-negative
alone O
will O
keep O
us O
from O
making O
a O
return O
visit O
. O

I O
can't O
wait O
for O
summer O
, O
when O
they O
serve O
outside O
on O
their O
gigantic O
patio B-positive
. O

You O
can O
do O
it O
here O
. O

My O
boyfriend O
and O
I O
went O
there O
to O
celebrate O
my O
birthday O
the O
other O
night O
and O
all O
I O
can O
say O
is O
that O
it O
was O
magnificent O
. O

It O
wasn't O
as O
if O
this O
restaurant B-negative
had O
any O
major O
bragging O
points O
before O
hand O
, O
but O
now O
it's O
simply O
repulsive O
. O

Too O
bad O
the O
food B-negative
wasn't O
of O
the O
same O
heritage O
. O

And O
it O
all O
comes O
at O
a O
very O
reasonable O
price O
( O
congee B-positive
, O
noodles B-positive
, O
and O
rice B-positive
dishes I-positive
are O
no O
more O
than O
$ O
3-6 O
each O
) O
. O

Addicting O
! O

would O
NOT O
go O
back O
. O

supercilious O
scorn O
is O
in O

I've O
been O
here O
twice O
now O

Small O

i O
had O
salmon B-negative
( O
wasnt O

had O
chicken B-positive
, O
it O
was O
good O
. O

Just O
ignore O
the O
trendy O
wannabes O
. O

great O
service B-positive

So O
rushing O
us O
out O
was O
absolutely O
unnecessary O

The O

a O
real O

for O
me O
. O

Went O
there O
for O
an O
office O
lunch O
. O

Have O
been O
dozens O

the O

incredible O
and O
the O

good O
at O
their O

cultured O
. O

I O
have O
eaten O
here O
three O
times O
and O
have O
found O
the O
quality O
and O
variety O
of O
the O
fish B-positive
to O
be O
excellent O
. O

We O
did O
have O
the O
same O
waiter B-positive
the O
second O
time O
, O
so O
maybe O
the O
service O
is O
spotty O
and O
our O
luck O
is O
good O
. O

And O
the O
upstairs B-positive
is O
a O
great O
place O

Over O

this O
not-so-little O
gem O

it O
amazing O

not-so-frequent O

The O

I O

so O
happy O
to O
have O
a O
wonderful O
Italian B-positive
restaurant I-positive
in O

This O

would O
be O

better O
served O
by O
being O
run O
by O
a O
group O
that O
actually O
understands O

I O
thought O

The O
food B-positive
is O
all O

for O
San O

standards O
. O

We O
went O
around O
9:30 O
on O
a O
Friday O
and O
it O
had O
died O
down O
a O
bit O
by O
then O
so O
the O
service B-positive
was O
great O
! O

Cool O
atmosphere B-positive
, O
the O
fire B-positive
place I-positive
in O
the O
back O
really O
ads O
to O
it O
but O
needs O
a O
bit O
more O
heat O
throughout O
on O
a O
cold O
night O
. O

The O
food B-positive
was O
very O
good O
, O
a O
great O
deal O
, O
and O
the O
place B-positive
its O
self O
was O
great O
. O

those O
rolls B-neutral
were O
big O
, O
but O
not O
good O
and O
sashimi B-negative
wasn't O
fresh O
. O

Love O
it O
. O

We O
were O
ushered O
to O
the O
bar O
to O
wait O
momentarily O
and O
upon O
arrival O
were O
so O
excited O
. O

The O
best O
Chuwam B-positive
Mushi I-positive
I O
have O
ever O
had O
. O

Much O
more O
than O
just O
a O
great O
view B-positive
! O

We O
had O
a O
very O
hard O
time O
getting O
the O
waitress B-negative
' O
attention O
and O
finally O
had O
to O
get O
up O
and O
go O
inside O
to O
speak O
to O
a O
manager O
. O

I O
was O
pleasantly O
suprised O
. O

Inexpensive O
, O
unassuming O
, O
great O
time O
! O

highly O
recommended O
. O

The O
restaurant B-neutral
is O
a O
bit O
noisy O
but O
that O
is O
something O
that O
can O
be O
overlooked O
once O
you O
sit O
down O
and O
enjoy O
a O
great O
meal B-positive

Holy O

I O
ordered O
the O
Lobster O

The O

and O
the O

is O
great O

I O
had O
the O
beef O
kabobs O
with O
a O
side O
of O
cucumber O

. O

I O
was O
pleasantly O
surprised O
to O
find O
this O
gem O
in O
Hoboken O
. O

I O
had O
never O
had O
Edamame B-positive
pureed I-positive
before O
but O
I O
thought O
it O
was O
innovative O
and O
tasty O
( O
could've O
used O
a O
bit O
more O
salt O
) O
. O

The O
lobster B-positive
sandwich I-positive
is O
$ O
24 O
and O
although O
it O
was O
good O
it O
was O
not O
nearly O
enough O
to O
warrant O
that O
price O
. O

Check O
out O
the O
secret O
back B-positive
room I-positive

The O
waiter B-positive

Surprised O
that O
a O
place O
of O
this O
caliber O
would O
advertise O
it O
as O
Kobe O
. O

The O
pizza B-positive
’ I-positive
s I-positive
are O
thin O
crust O
and O
the O
menu B-positive
offers O
very O
creative O
combinations O
and O
toppings O
. O

The O
only O
problem O
would O
be O
the O
wait B-neutral
, O
but O
we O
usually O
just O
have O
a O
drink O
in O
the O
front O
while O
waiting O
. O

I'm O
not O
picky O
- O
but O
it O
was O
actually O
gross O
. O

This O

is O
always O
packed O

We O
ordered O

The O

Food B-neutral

just O
average O
... O
if O
they O
lowered O
the O

just O
a O

it O
would O

Insultingly O
Overpriced O

For O
the O
price O
, O
you O
cannot O
eat O
this O
well O
in O
Manhattan O
. O

Salads B-positive

The O

rather O
good O
, O
but O
only O
if O

a O

a O
good O
chew O
, O
the O
sauce B-positive
is O
light O
with O
a O
nice O
acidity O
to O
it O
, O
the O
salt O
from O
the O
cheese B-positive
is O
great O
, O
really O
heightens O
the O

Went O

the O
prixe B-positive

is O
the O
greatest O

for O
a O
good O

and O
they O

to O
any O

allergies O
or O

I O

Yes O
, O
the O

I O
felt O
it O
was O
worth O
it O

LLOOVVE O
THIS O

After O
all O
that O
, O
they O

The O

This O

The O

Better O
than O
the O

I O
read O

called O

I O
thought O
to O

may O
be O
it O

worth O
it O

This O
place B-positive

so O

The O

The O

It's O
located O
in O
a O

not O
the O

the O

I O
decide O

mom O
originally O
introduced O
me O
to O
this O
place O
, O
but O
even O
she O
( O
being O
Indian O
) O
feels O
the O
food B-negative
can O
be O
somewhat O
over O
the O
top O
spicy O
and O
far O
too O
oily O
. O

They O
are O
not O
helpful O
in O
the O
least O
and O
will O
give O
you O
the O
grand O
run O
around O
so O
by O
the O
time O
the O
event O
date O
rolls O
around O
you O
will O
not O
only O
regret O
chosing O
this O
place O
, O
but O
also O
become O
hostile O
! O

Overall O
the O
restaurant O
is O
more O
expensive O
than O
our O
other O
sushi O
favorites O
, O
but O
everything O
was O
delicious O
. O

The O
food B-positive
was O
authentic O
. O

I O
visit O
New O
Green O
Bo O
when O
I O
have O
money O
or O
when O
I O
am O
broke O
. O

A O
little O
overpriced O
but O
worth O
it O
once O
you O
take O
a O
bite O
. O

You O
are O
likely O
to O
be O
disappointed O
. O

If O
you O
’ O
re O
planning O
to O
come O
here O
, O
make O
sure O
that O
your O
date O
is O
someone O
whom O
you O
really O
like O
since O
you O
’ O
ll O
be O
ushered O
to O
private B-positive

there O
will O
be O
no O

The O
pizza B-negative
was O
delivered O
cold O
and O
the O
cheese B-negative
wasn't O
even O
fully O
melted O
! O

We've O
lived O
around O
the O
corner O
from O
this O
place O
for O
over O
a O
year O
and O
finally O
had O
dinner O
there O
. O

The O
bar B-positive
is O
very O
well O
stocked O
with O
interesting O
beers B-positive
and O
well O
priced O
wines B-positive

– O
I O
don't O
understand O
how O
I O
was O
a O
stranger O
to O
this O

so O
long O
... O
the O

the O

EVERYTHING O

it O
didn't O
spill O

the O

Prices O

No O
Comparison O

I O
felt O
ackward O
and O
next O
time O
went O
to O
the O
casino O
bathroom O
. O

The O
dosas B-negative
are O
skimpy O
, O
unattractive O
and O
drip O
with O
grease O
, O
and O
personally O
I'd O
drink O
popcorn O
topping O
before O
I'd O
eat O
another O
one O
of O
these O
. O

Everything O
we O
had O
was O
good O
or O
ok O
... O
but O
definitely O
nothing O
great O
. O

When O
we O
stumbled O
on O
Leon B-negative
, O
we O
thought O
that O
we O
had O
found O
quite O
the O
gem O
BUT O
, O
we O
were O
certainly O
wrong O
. O

Still O
we O
keep O
going O
back O
:) O

The O
food B-neutral
is O
very O
good O
, O
but O
not O

When O
I O

My O

The O

however O
the O

incredibly O

My O

Our O

continued O
to O
be O
attentive O
throughout O
the O
night O
, O
but O
I O
did O
remain O
puzzled O
by O
one O
issue O
: O
Who O
thinks O
that O
Ray's B-neutral
is O
an O
appropriate O
place O
to O
take O
young O

The O

But O

the O
way O
I O
remember O
them O
to O
taste O
when O
I O
was O
growing O
up O
in O
Taiwan O

There O
was O
a O

while O
sitting O

we O
watched O
the O

accidentally O
drop O
a O

upon O
retrieving O
it O

proceed O

they O
are O
all O

Save O
room O
for O
scrumptious O

We O
all O
ordered O
different O

dumping O
our O

of O
us O
halfway O
through O
our O
appetizer B-positive
( O

The O

Okay-i O
don't O

the O

it O
was O

too O
bland O

we O
are O
for O
sure O
coming O

The O

My O

They O
should O
have O
called O
it O

chips-good O
but O
a O
far O
cry O
from O
what O
the O
name O
implies O
. O

I O
took O
my O
boyfriend O
for O
a O
dinner O
on O
saturday O

There O

ordered O
the O
smoked B-negative
salmon I-negative
and I-negative
roe I-negative
appetizer I-negative
and O
it O
was O
off O

. O

I O
should O
have O
just O
asked O
for O
the O
check O
when O
I O
saw O
that O
; O
but O
their O
menu B-positive
was O
so O
unique O
that O
I O
continued O

The O

was O
quiet O

delightful O

I O
went O

great O
food B-positive

The O
food B-positive
was O
excellent O
as O
well O
as O
service B-positive
, O
however O
, O
I O
left O
The B-negative
Four I-negative
Seasons I-negative
very O
dissappointed O
. O

That O
was O
the O
last O
night O
in O
Vegas O
and O
was O
too O
late O
and O
most O
of O
the O
restaurant O
were O
closing O
- O
so O
we O
walked O
in O
the O
check O
the O
place O
. O

The O
people B-positive
that O
work O
there O
are O
always O
so O
friendly O
you O
forget O
you O
are O
in O
New O
York O
sometimes O
. O

Fresh O
ingrediants B-positive
and O
super O
tasty O
. O

I O
found O
it O
on O
a O
cold O
night O
, O
the O
perfect O
spot B-positive
to O
warm O
up O
. O

Maybe O
it O
is O
good O
for O
that O
one O
night O
once O
in O
a O
blue O
moon O
when O
the O
chefs O
decide O
to O
use O
fish B-negative
that's O
half-way O
decent O
. O

I O
come O
from O
a O
family O
of O
pizzeria O
owners O
, O
and O
I'm O
almost O
ashamed O
to O
say O
that O
the O
pizza B-positive
in O
Fornino's O
blows O
my O
families O
receipies O
away O
. O

The O
seats B-negative
are O
uncomfortable O
if O
you O
are O
sitting O
against O
the O
wall O
on O
wooden O
benches O
. O

I O
highly O
recommend O
the O
restaurant B-positive
based O
on O
our O
experience O
last O
night O
. O

My O
only O
negative O
comment O
is O
that O
I O
wish O
the O
pieces B-negative
were O
a O
little O
bigger O
. O

I O
may O
not O
be O
a O
sushi O
guru O
but O
I O
can O
tell O
you O
that O
the O
food B-negative
here O
is O
just O
okay O
and O
that O
there O
is O
not O
much O
else O
to O
it O
. O

Ravioli B-positive
was O
good O
... O
but O
I O
have O
to O
say O
that O
I O
found O
everything O
a O
bit O
overpriced O
. O

A O
gentleman B-negative
, O
maybe O
the O
manager O
, O
came O
to O
our O
table O
, O
and O
without O
so O
much O
as O
a O
smile O
or O
greeting O
asked O
for O
our O
order O
. O

I O
like O
Cafe B-positive
Noir I-positive
dont O
get O
me O
wrong O
, O
it O
is O
jsut O
that O
the O
people B-negative
who O
work O
there O
are O
evil O
and O
incompetent O
! O
! O

Truly O
the O
mark O
of O
an O
attentive O
waiter B-positive
. O

They O
were O
very O
abrupt O
with O
me O
when O
I O
called O
and O
actually O
claimed O
the O
food O
was O
late O
because O
they O
were O
out O
of O
rice O
. O

The O
chicken B-positive
curry I-positive
and O
chicken B-positive
tikka I-positive
masala I-positive
are O
my O
favorite O
meat O
dishes O
. O

The O
have O
over O
100 O
different O
beers B-positive
to O
offer O
thier O
guest O
so O
that O
made O
my O
husband O
very O
happy O
and O
the O
food B-positive
was O
delicious O
, O
if O
I O
must O
recommend O
a O
dish O
it O
must O
be O
the O
pumkin B-positive
tortelini I-positive
. O

I O
wasn't O
thrilled O
to O
have O
to O
wait O
on O
line O
for O
thirty O
minutes O
, O
but O
I O
guess O
that's O
the O
price O
you O
pay O
for O
a O
popular O
place O
. O

Taxan B-positive
delicious O
! O

Authentic O
Korean O

should O
visit O

course O
. O

Well O
I O
guess O
it's O
hard O
to O
be O
seated O
when O
one O
is O
invisible O
to O
the O
staff B-negative
. O

great O
service B-positive
. O

Just O
want O
to O
warn O
you O
all O
- O
don't O
waste O
your O
time O
and O
money O
. O

I O
went O
here O
for O
a O
family O
birthday O
dinner O
. O

This O
place B-positive
is O
worth O
an O
one-hour O
drive O
. O

We O
called O
the O
other O
person O
who O
was O
very O
close O
by O
, O
and O
she O
told O
us O
to O
order O
for O
her O
, O
so O
we O
did O
. O

It's O
just O
the O
right O
size O
for O
the O
menu O
. O

We O
are O
very O
particular O
about O
sushi B-positive
and O
were O
both O
please O
with O
every O
choice O
which O
included O
: O
ceviche B-positive
mix I-positive
( I-positive
special I-positive
) I-positive
, O
crab B-positive
dumplings I-positive
, O
assorted B-positive
sashimi I-positive

, O
two O
types O
of O

and O
the O
banana B-positive
tempura I-positive
. O

yummy O
. O

I O
attended O
a O
holiday O
dinner O
at O
the O
restaurant O
, O
and O
the O
food B-negative
was O
majorly O
disappointing O
. O

it O
gets O
really O
busy O
, O
so O
get O
there O
on O
the O
early O
side O
so O
you O
can O
grab O
a O
seat O
, O
if O
you O
do O
have O
to O
wait O
, O
its O
not O
bad O
because O
the O
service B-positive
is O
quick O
! O

of O

A O

The O

really O
make O
for O
an O
enjoyable O
experience O

This O
place B-positive
is O
a O
great O
bargain O

The O

How O
is O
this O
palce B-negative
still O
open O
? O

All O
their O
menu B-positive
items I-positive
are O
a O
hit O
, O
and O
they O
serve O
mimosas O
. O

To O
their O
credit O
they O
removed O
the O
dish O
from O
the O
check O
; O
but O
no O
manager B-negative
stopped O
by O
to O
ask O
what O
the O

Had O
an O
awful O
experience O
at O
Casa B-negative

on O
a O
Saturday O

and O
the O

was O

even O
on O

Great O

I O

The O
food B-negative
they O
serve O
is O
not O
comforting O
, O
not O
appetizing O
and O
uncooked O

then O
we O
ordered O
a O
dinosaur O

THE O
BIG O
COMPLAINT O
: O
NO O
TOASTING O
AVAILABLE O
. O

Seafood B-positive
Plus O

– O
Pretty O
cheap O
for O
sit O
down O
Mexican O
AND O
downtown O
. O

But O
they O
do O
. O

The O
place B-negative
is O
small O
and O
cramped O
but O
the O
food B-positive
is O
fantastic O
. O

I O
noticed O
alot O
of O
indian O
people O
eatting O
there O
which O
is O
a O
great O
sign O
for O
an O
indian B-positive
place I-positive
! O

I O
would O
highly O
recommand O
requesting O
a O
table O
by O
the O
window O
. O

The O
combination O
of O
super-fresh O
ingredients B-positive
in O
the O
dishes O
are O
unusual O
but O
really O
delicious O
. O

My O
boyfriend O
asked O
me O
if O
I O
wanted O
to O
switch O
and O
eat O
his O
salmon O
instead O
, O
while O
he O
de-skinned O
the O
chicken O
so O
that O
I O
could O
enjoy O
the O
white O
meat O
. O

Overpriced O

When O
I O
got O
there O
the O
place O
was O
packed O
but O
they O
made O
sure O
to O
seat O
me O
quickly O
. O

There O
is O
no O
excuse O
for O
such O
lousy O
service B-negative
! O

The O
scallops B-positive
are O
apparently O
cooked O
in O
a O
black O
olive O
butter O
which O
really O
makes O
them O
unique O
( O
not O
to O
mention O
tasty O
) O
. O

You O
can't O
say O
its O
cheap O
because O
food O
is O
cheaper O
in O
Chinatown O
. O

We O
easily O
spent O
more O
than O
$ O
40 O
per O
person O
( O
not O
including O
alcohol O
) O
and O
were O
still O
hungry O
. O

It O
is O
a O
lot O
of O
fun O
with O
live O
entertainment O
and O
all O
kinds O
of O
Disney O
type O
special O
effects O
. O

Their O
bagels B-negative
are O
fine O
, O
but O
they O
are O
a O
little O
overcooked O
, O
and O
not O
really O
a O
' O
special O
' O
bagel O
experience O
. O

Great O
spot B-positive
, O
whether O
looking O
for O
a O
couple O
of O
drinks O
or O
quiet O
dinner O
. O

The O
svc B-negative
can O
be O
a O
bit O
rude O
at O
times O
, O
esp O
if O
you O
have O
big O
group O
, O
but O
overall O
the O
restaurant B-positive
is O
a O
must O
! O

Great O
food B-positive
, O
great O
prices O
, O
great O
service B-positive
. O

Someone O
else O
recommended O
the O
dessert B-negative
- O
we O
also O
left O
that O
. O

Finally O
, O
my O
wife O
stood O
face O
to O
face O
in O
front O
of O
one O
of O
the O
staff B-negative
and O
she O
asked O
, O
" O
Are O
you O
waiting O
for O
a O
table O
? O
" O

Good O
, O
fast O
service B-positive
. O

less O
wait O
time O
for O
me O
! O

I O
was O
looking O
for O
banana O
tempura O
for O
dessert B-negative
and O
they O
dont O
have O
. O

I'm O
a O
born O
and O
bred O
Southend O
resident O
and O
was O
excited O
to O
hear O
of O
this O
restaurant O
opening O
. O

The O
wine B-positive
list I-positive
is O
also O
really O
nice O
. O

Dumbfoundingly O
Poor O

Warning O
: O
You O
may O
find O
it O
difficult O
to O
dine O
at O
other O
Japanese O
restaurants O
after O
a O
visit O
to O
Mizu B-positive
! O

We O
were O
seated O
right O
away O
, O
the O
table B-positive
was O
private O
and O
nice O
. O

I O
love O
sushi O
, O
and O
I O
have O
eaten O
it O
all O
over O
the O
world O
. O

For O
those O
that O
go O
once O
and O
don't O
enjoy O
it O
, O
all O
I O
can O
say O
is O
that O
they O
just O
don't O
get O
it O
. O

it's O
a O
perfect O
place O
to O
have O
a O
amanzing O
indian B-positive
food I-positive
. O

Everything O
I O
had O
was O
good O
, O
and O
I'm O
a O
eater O
. O

It O
is O
obvious O
that O
no O
one O
in O
the O
restaurant O
has O
any O
idea O
about O
or O
experience O
with O
Japanese B-negative
cuisine I-negative
. O

They O
were O
such O
a O
rip-off O
( O
$ O
8.95 O
for O
four O
small O
meat O
patties O
in O
steamed O
buns O
) O
and O
not O
worth O
trying O
. O

Not O
worth O
it O
. O

The O
hostess O
said O
" O
Wow O
that's O
a O
large O
group O
, O
unless O
you O
aren't O
together O
" O
, O
to O
which O
I O
replied O
" O
no O
we O
are O
, O
and O
there O
will O
be O
one O
more O
, O
so O
a O
table O
for O
six O
please O
. O
" O

Servers O
are O
all O
different O
, O
Greg B-positive
is O
my O
favorite O
. O

The O
only O
thing O
you O
can O
do O
here O
is O
walk O
in O
and O
eat O
.. O
but O
planning O
an O
event O
, O
especially O
a O
small O
, O
intimate O
one O
, O
forget O
about O
it O
. O

Service B-negative
was O
slow O
had O
to O
wait O
to O
order O
and O
get O
food O
although O
not O
crowded O
. O

We O
were O
very O
disappointed O
. O

The O
reason O
there O
are O
4 O
different O
results O
on O
citysearch O
for O
the O
same O
place O
is O
because O
they O
keep O
trying O
to O
start O
a O
new O
thread O
so O
they O
can O
stock O
it O
with O
positive O
reviews O
. O

Given O
that O
Ray's O
is O
a O
seafood O
restaurant O
... O
well O
, O
you O
get O
the O
idea O
... O

We O
were O
planning O
to O
get O
dessert O
but O
the O
waitress B-negative
basically O
through O
the O
bill O
at O
us O
before O
we O
had O
a O
chance O
to O
order O
. O

The O
ambiance B-positive
was O
a O
peaceful O
and O
relaxing O
break O
amongst O
all O
the O
kids O
running O
around O
in O
Downtown O
Disney O
. O

The O
restaurant O
was O
80 O
% O
full O
and O
there O
was O
a O
sign O
posted O
" O
wait O
to O
be O
seated O
. O
" O

not O
in O

I O
don't O

After O
hearing O
a O
lot O
of O
great O
things O
about O
the O
restaurant O
, O
and O
passing O
by O
it O
on O
a O
daily O
basis O
, O
we O
decided O
to O
try O
. O

I O
don't O
think O
I O
would O
go O
again O
. O

You O
can O
order O
to O
go O
if O
you O
have O
to O
get O
back O
to O
the O
office O
too O
! O

I O
have O
never O
eaten O
in O
the O
restaurant O
, O
however O
, O
upon O
reading O
the O
reviews O
I O
got O
take O
out O
last O
week O
. O

The O
food B-positive
is O
so O
cheap O
and O
the O
waiters B-positive
are O
nice O
. O

I O
can't O
! O
! O
! O

The O
wife O
had O
the O
risotto B-positive
which O
was O
amazing O
. O

It O
may O
be O
a O
bit O
packed O
on O
weekends O
, O
but O
the O
vibe B-positive
is O
good O
and O
it O
is O
the O
best O
French B-positive
food I-positive
you O
will O
find O
in O
the O
area O
. O

– O
... O
and O
the O
best O
summertime O
deck B-positive
experience--they O
will O
even O
bring O
you O
a O
blanket O
if O
you O
get O
cold O
in O
the O
Seattle O
evening O

. O

I O
have O
been O
to O
Rao's B-positive
probably O
15 O
times O
the O
past O
3 O
years O
and O
it O
keeps O
getting O
better O
. O

The O
only O
positive O
thing O
about O
Mioposto B-negative
is O
the O
nice O
location B-positive
. O

However O
, O
our O
main B-positive
course I-positive
was O
wonderful O
. O

Never O
again O

Their O
specialty B-positive
rolls I-positive
are O
impressive O
, O
though O
I O
can't O
remember O
what O
we O
had O
. O

The O
ambience B-positive
was O
so O
fun O
, O
and O
the O
prices O
were O
great O
, O
on O
top O
of O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
food B-positive
was O
really O
tasty O
. O

The O
seafood B-positive
is O
amazing O
, O
there's O
a O
good O
wine B-positive
list I-positive
, O
and O
the O
ever-changing O
menu B-positive
always O
offers O
some O
great O
surprises O
. O

I O
will O
be O
going O
back O
very O
soon O
. O

The O

Citrus I-positive
Vodka I-positive
and I-positive
lemon I-positive
and I-positive
lime I-positive
juice I-positive
and I-positive
mint I-positive
leaves I-positive
that O
is O
to O
die O
for O
! O

The O
food B-negative
was O
mediocre O
at O
best O
but O
it O
was O
the O
horrible O
service B-negative
that O
made O
me O
vow O
never O
to O
go O
back O
. O

I O
really O
loved O
the O
different O
and O
inovated O
touch O
that's O
the O
cheff B-positive
gives O
to O
the O
food O
. O

We O
did O
tip O
, O
I O
guess O
the O
model O
/ O
waitress B-negative
just O
wanted O
more O
and O
complained O
to O
the O
manager O
. O

The O
food B-positive
is O
flavorful O
, O
plentiful O
and O
reasonably O
priced O
. O

So O
, O
I O
switch O
with O
my O
boyfriend O
again O
to O
see O
if O
maybe O
I O
could O
stomach O
the O
meat O
and O
spinach O
again O
, O
but O
the O
spinach B-negative
was O
so O
undercooked O
that O
I O
just O
could O
not O
bite O
through O
it O
. O

Some O
Pineapple O
covered O
in O
a O
glaze O
of O
some O
kind O
and O
some O
pear O
tart O
thing O
Not O
impressive O
at O
all O
. O

plenty O
of O
food B-positive
, O
trust O
me O
. O

My O

. O

I O
am O
relatively O
new O
to O
the O
area O
and O
tried O
Pick O
a O
bgel O
on O
2nd O
and O
was O
disappointed O
with O
the O
service B-negative
and O
I O
thought O
the O
food B-negative
was O
overated O
and O
on O
the O
pricey O
side O
. O

But O
the O
pizza B-negative
is O
way O
to O
expensive O
. O

A O
great O
place B-positive
to O
meet O
up O
for O
some O
food O
and O
drinks O
... O

Go O
hungry O
and O
enjoy O
. O

– O
Every O
neighborhood O
has O
a O
few O
great O
local O
bars O
that O
are O
the O
best O
secrets O
. O

Go O
with O
some O
friends O
, O
wait O
the O
half O
hour O
or O
so O
with O
a O
cup O
of O
joe O
, O
and O
enjoy O
more O
than O
your O
average O
breakfast B-positive
. O

I O
love O
this O
place B-positive

Maybe O
it O
has O
improved O
since O
then O
? O

When O
we O
inquired O
about O
ports O
- O
the O
waitress B-negative
listed O
off O
several O
but O
did O
not O
know O
taste O
variations O
or O
cost O
. O

The O
mussles B-negative
were O
the O
fishiest O
things O
I've O
ever O
tasted O
, O
the O
seabass B-negative
was O
bland O
, O
the O
goat B-negative

had O
bones O
in O
it O
... O
It O
was O
disgusting O
. O

I O
grew O
up O
on O
these O
bagels O

The O
food B-negative
however O
, O
is O
what O
one O
might O
expect O
. O

Eat O
at O
your O
own O
risk O

This O
is O
the O
first O

I've O
been O
that O
a O

remembers O
my O

half O
a O

my O
restaurant O

I O
tried O
removing O
the O
hollondaise O
sauce O
completely O
that O
was O
how O
failed O
it O
was O
. O

The O
hostess B-negative
is O
rude O
to O
the O
point O
of O
being O
offensive O
. O

We O
could O
have O
made O
a O
meal O
of O
the O
yummy O
dumplings B-positive
from O
the O
dumpling O
menu O
. O

the O
pad B-positive

The O
hanger B-negative
steak I-negative
was O
like O
rubber O
and O
the O
tuna B-negative
was O
flavorless O
not O
to O
mention O
it O
tasted O
like O
it O
had O

been O
thawed O

All O
in O

while O
the O
fish B-positive
is O
unquestionably O
fresh O

rolls B-negative
tend O
to O
be O
inexplicably O
bland O
. O

Service B-positive
was O
also O
very O
good O
. O

Though O
, O
one O
thing O
I O
realized O
later O
on O
was O
that O
the O
restaurant O
either O
used O
MSG O
or O
a O
meat O
tenderizer O
on O
the O
steak B-negative

the O
little O
details O
in O
the O

Maggot O
in O

I O
wish O

No O

here O
a O
week O

and O
found O
most O
dishes B-negative
average O
at O
best O
and O
too O
expensive O
. O

The O
food B-negative
is O
decent O
at O
best O
, O
and O
the O
ambience B-negative
, O
well O
, O
it's O
a O
matter O
of O
opinion O
, O
some O
may O
consider O
it O
to O
be O
a O
sweet O
thing O
, O
I O
thought O
it O
was O
just O
annoying O
. O

Wonderful O
strawberry B-positive

They O

By O

If O
you O

cheap O
eats B-positive
- O
this O
is O
the O
place O
. O

every O
month O
if O
possible O
. O

I O
love O
Indian O
food O
and O
consider O
myself O
to O
be O
quite O
an O
expert O
on O
it O
. O

If O
you O
don't O
mind O
pre-sliced O
low O
quality O
fish B-negative
, O
unfriendly O
staff B-negative
and O
a O
sushi B-negative
chef I-negative
that O
looks O
like O
he O
is O
miserable O
then O
this O
is O
your O
place O
. O

My O
husband O
and O
I O
take O
out O
from O
here O
3-4 O
times O
a O
month O
. O

It O
was O
divine O
melts O
in O
your O
mouth O
. O

We O
ate O
at O
this O
Thai O
place O
following O
the O
reviews O
but O
very O
unhappy O
with O
the O
foods B-negative
. O

The O
presentation O
of O
the O
food B-positive
was O
an O
added O
bonus O
, O
it O
looked O
just O
as O
great O
as O
it O
tasted O
! O

It O
was O
wonderful O
. O

That's O
a O
huge O
compliment O
, O
especially O
in O
the O
fickled O
restaurant O
business O
, O
... O
enough O
already O
! O

We O
paid O
and O
left O
because O
we O
didn't O
feel O
like O
arguing O
any O
more O
. O

any O
further O
needs O
we O
may O
have O
had O
could O
not O
have O
been O
met O
since O
no O
one O
stopped O
by O
the O
table O
. O

While O
this O
diner O
had O
reasonably O
good O
food B-positive
, O
the O
restaurant B-negative
staff I-negative
seemed O
completely O
indifferent O
to O
our O
presence O
, O
and O
this O
attitude O
was O
reflected O
in O
the O
lack O
of O
service O
. O

We O
won't O
go O
to O
this O
place O
again O
for O
a O
good O
meal B-negative
. O

The O
decor B-neutral
however O
seems O
to O
be O
the O
distraction O
so O
you O
won't O
notice O
that O
you O
just O
payed O
300 O
bucks O
for O
some O
cold O
eggplant B-negative
that O
took O
2 O
FRICKIN O
HOURS O
TO O
COME O

Don't O
get O
me O
started O
on O
the O

The O
Seafood B-positive

It O

absolutely O
amazing O
. O

I O
have O
been O
going O
there O
since O
it O
opened O
and O
I O
can't O
get O
enough O
. O

They O
charge O
different O
prices O
all O
the O
time O
. O

In O
about O
12 O
minutes O
, O
the O
thing O
is O
gone O
. O

Not O
only O
is O
the O
cuisine B-positive
the O
best O
around O
, O
the O
service B-positive
has O
always O
been O
attentive O
and O
charming O
. O

The O
food B-positive
we O
ordered O
was O
excellent O
, O
although O
I O
wouldn't O
say O
the O
margaritas B-neutral
were O
anything O
to O
write O
home O
about O
. O

I O
was O
almost O
amused O
by O
the O
fact O
that O
she O
was O
turning O
away O
customers O
at O
9pm O
on O
a O
Friday O
night O
because O
she O
" O
had O
a O
BBQ O
to O
go O
to O
" O
that O
night O
- O
WTF O
? O
? O

We O
go O
often O
for O
lunch O
and O
the O
place O
is O
packed O
. O

You O
never O
feel O
icky O
and O
stuffed O
after O
you O
eat O
there O

A O

I O

that O

our O

I O
picked O
the O
asparagus B-positive

which O
turned O
out O

be O
incredible O

perfectly O

Once O

about O
30 O

I O

the O

only O
way O
this O

such O

The O

I O
think O
the O
stuff O
was O
better O
than O
Disney O

Since O
we O
were O
already O
waiting O
so O
long O
, O
we O
felt O
we O
had O
no O
other O
choice O

to O
accept O
it O

The O
first O
time O
the O
sushi B-positive

outstanding O
, O
the O

time O
it O
was O
a O

We O
have O
gone O

the O

the O

the O

the O
reason O
to O

As O
to O
my O
comment O
about O
the O

, O
no O
apology O

When O
we O
threatened O

Most O

, O
we O
were O
so O
excited O
about O
the O
food O
after O
seeing O
the O
very O
creative O

They O
never O

our O

it O

the O

I O

can O
’ O

enough O
good O
things O
about O

The O

Its O
located O

It's O
a O
great O
little O
place B-positive
with O
tons O
of O
potential O
to O
be O
a O
neighborhood O
joint O
if O
the O
service B-negative
weren't O
so O
impersonal O
and O
corporate-like O
. O

We O
never O
ate O
because O
by O
close O
to O

in O
the O

we O
were O
not O
served O
and O
were O
too O
upset O

I O
have O
eaten O
at O
many O
pizza O
places O
around O
NYC O

this O

hands O
down O
the O
worst O

To O
be O
honest O
we O
only O
ever O
eat O
the O
Shabu O
Shabu O

I O
would O
recommend O
Roxy's O
for O
that O
, O
but O
not O
for O
their O
food B-negative

Nevertheless O
, O
I O
finished O
my O
plate O

and O
that's O
when O
I O
found O
a O
maggot O

If O
you O
like O
the O

and O
the O
value O
you O
get O
from O
some O
of O
Chinatown O

this O
is O
not O
the O

for O
you O

Although O
the O

I O

enjoyed O
the O
black B-positive

But O
the O
best O
part O
about O
LS O
is O
the O
late B-positive
night I-positive
atmosphere I-positive
, O
delightfully O
free O
of O
the O

She O
then O
put O
the O
check O
down O
without O
asking O
if O
we O
were O
done O
, O
and O
came O
to O
check O
on O
the O

every O
two O

even O
though O
we O
were O
one O
of O

Highly O

My O
wife O
also O
ordered O
a O
teapot O
of O
hot O
water O
( O
she O
had O
a O
sore O
throat O
) O
and O
I O
guess O
that O
since O
it O
was O
only O
water O
, O
it O
wasn't O
a O
priority O
for O
them O
to O
actually O
bring O
it O
. O

The O
dinner O
only O
took O
us O
about O
an O
hour O
and O
the O
prices O
were O
alright O
for O
the O
strip O
, O
almost O
$ O
50 O
/ O
pp O
after O
tax O
and O
tip O
( O
about O
average O
) O
. O

She O
doesn't O
make O
you O
feel O
welcome O
and O
treats O
you O
like O
an O
annoyance O
. O

I O
would O
say O
that O
all O
was O
fine O
and O
tasty O
but O
the O
heaviness O
on O
my O
stomach O
someting O
that O
i O
can't O
not O
mention O
or O
undermine O
. O

the O
only O
problem O
is O
you O
really O
have O
to O
warm O
up O
the O
pizza B-negative
before O
it's O
edible O
, O
even O
when O
you O
order O

If O
the O

They O
serve O
it O
in O
a O
tall O

skinny O
hour-glass O

the O

that O
you O

trust O
me O

they O
will O
charge O
you O
through O

just O
so O
that O
you O
can O
say O

When O
you O
add O

The O
music B-positive
playing O
was O
very O
hip O
, O
20-30 O
something O
pop O
music O
, O
but O
the O
subwoofer B-negative
to I-negative
the I-negative
sound I-negative
system I-negative
was O
located O
under O
my O
seat O
, O
which O
became O
annoying O
midway O
through O
dinner O

I O

there O

Not O

has O
great O
food B-positive
! O

We O
will O
be O
back O

Much O
more O
reasonably O
priced O
too O
! O

Still O
, O
any O
quibbles O
about O
the O
bill O
were O
off-set O
by O
the O
pour-your-own O
measures B-positive
of I-positive
liquers I-positive
which O
were O
courtesey O
of O
the O
house O
... O

Place B-positive
is O
open O
till O
late O
, O
no O
dress O
code O
. O

And O
the O
service B-positive
was O
simply O
spendid O
- O
quite O
a O
delight O
. O

The O
spicy B-positive
Tuna I-positive
roll I-positive
is O
huge O
and O
probably O
the O
best O
that O
I've O
had O
at O
this O
price O
range O
. O

I'm O
telling O
you O
... O

Another O
review O
here O
claimed O
the O
pre-fix O
was O
$ O
29 O

it O
is O
$ O
55 O
per O

not O

Staff B-positive
is O
very O
accomodating O
. O

Service B-positive
was O
very O
prompt O
but O
slightly O
rushed O
. O

Many O
people O
talk O
about O
the O
great O
pizza B-positive
and O
poor O
service B-negative
, O
so O
it O
can't O
just O
be O
the O
rantings O
of O
a O
few O
dissatisfied O
customers O
. O

the O
fish B-positive
was O
fresh O
, O
though O
it O
was O
cut O
very O
thin O
. O

never O
swaying O
, O
never O
a O
bad O

never O
bad O

I O
have O
to O
say O
that O
I O
am O
pleasantly O
suprised O

I O
will O
most O
likely O
stop O
in O
again O
if O
I O
am O
in O

best O

i O

this O
place O
to O
all O
that O
want O
to O
try O
indain B-positive
food I-positive
for O
the O
first O
time O
. O

The O
waitress B-negative
was O
not O
attentive O
at O
all O
. O

Be O
sure O
to O
try O
the O
oyster B-positive
roll I-positive

Looking O
around O
, O
I O
saw O
a O
room O
full O
of O
New O

enjoying O
a O
real O
meal B-positive
in O
a O
real O
restaurant B-positive
, O
not O
a O
clubhouse O
of O
the O
fabulous O
trying O
to O
be O
seen O
. O

If O
only O
they O
delivered O
, O
they'd O
make O
a O
mint O
! O

it O
is O
not O
consistent O
. O

Excellent O
food B-positive
, O
although O
the O
interior B-negative
could O
use O
some O
help O
. O

I O
recently O
tried O
Suan B-positive
and O
I O
thought O
that O
it O
was O
great O
. O

The O
food B-positive
is O
simply O
unforgettable O
! O

I O
ordered O
the O
vitello B-positive
alla I-positive

and O
I O
was O
pretty O
impressed O
. O

I O
complained O
to O
the O
manager B-negative
, O
but O
he O
was O
not O
even O
apologetic O
. O

We O
had O
Lava O
Cake O
... O
we O
ordered O
when O
our O
food O
came O
it O
takes O
at O
least O
a O
1/2 O
to O
make O
it O
. O

The O
food B-positive
was O
good O
too O
. O

it's O
delicious O
! O

The O
service B-negative
ranges O
from O
mediocre O
to O
offensive O
. O

The O
only O
downside O
... O
they O
only O
take O
cash O
which O
is O
OK O
if O
you O
know O
about O
it O
ahead O
of O
time O
. O

My O
quesadilla B-negative
tasted O
like O
it O
had O
been O
made O
by O
a O
three-year O
old O
with O
no O
sense O

or O

The O

appetizing O

We O
have O
tried O
every O
Thai O

and O
Joya O

the O
best O

Seabass B-positive

I O
came O
across O
Village B-positive
Underground I-positive
by O

, O
now O
I O
go O
there O
all O
the O
time O

The O
atmosphere B-neutral
isn't O
the O
greatest O
, O
but O
I O
suppose O
that's O
how O
they O
keep O
the O
prices O
down O
. O

Too O
bad O
I O
had O
paid O
an O
extra O
$ O
2 O
for O
the O

Overall O

I O
don't O
appreciate O
places O

people O
that O
try O
to O
drive O
up O
the O
bill O
without O
the O
patron's O
knowledge O
so O
that O
was O
a O
huge O
turnoff O
( O
more O
than O
the O
price O
) O
. O

The O
food B-positive
was O
average O
or O
above O
including O
some O
surprising O
tasty O
dishes B-positive

The O
sushi B-negative
was O
awful O

I'm O
astonished O
that O
this O

my O

I'd O
go O
back O
there O
in O
a O

However O
it O

the O

Such O
a O
disappointment O

I O
look O
forward O
to O
eating O

What O
really O
makes O
it O
shine O
is O
the O
food B-positive
, O
which O
is O
aggressively O
seasoned O
with O
Cyrpriot O
spices O
, O
and O
all O
made O
in-house O
( O
even O
the O
gyro B-positive
meat I-positive

, O
and O
made O

much O
higher O
quality O

that O
might O
otherwise O
be O

I O
made O
my O
1st O
trip O
to O
the O
restaurant O
after O
finding O
their O
webpage O
online O

The O
servers B-negative
at O
Flatbush O

appear O
to O
have O
perfected O
that O
ghastly O
technique O
of O
making O
you O
feel O
guilty O

ashamed O
for O
deigning O
to O
attract O
their O
attention O

Hurley's O

ACTUALLY O
glad O
you O

For O

they O
delivered O

I O
was O
speechless O
by O
the O
horrible O
food B-negative
. O

Not O
sure O
if O
I O
would O
go O
back O
. O

Salads B-positive
are O
a O
delicious O
way O
to O
begin O
the O
meal O
. O

The O
only O
problem O
is O
that O
the O
manager B-negative
is O
a O
complete O
incompetent O
. O

This O
place B-positive
is O
charming O
and O
relaxing O
. O

My O
friends O
spoke O
so O
much O
about O
it O
for O
months O
, O
I O
finally O
made O
the O
time O
to O
come O
down O
ear O
and O
dine O
in O
. O

Well O
worth O
it O

Prices O
too O
high O
for O
this O
cramped O
and O
unappealing O
resturant B-negative
. O

The O
food B-positive
here O
does O
a O
great O
service O
to O
the O
name O
( O
Cantonese O
that O
is O
... O
) O
. O

This O
place B-positive
rocks O
! O
! O

Yakitori B-positive
( I-positive
bbq I-positive
meats I-positive
) I-positive
is O
tasty O
too O
. O

Parking O
is O
reasonably O
good O
, O
they O
have O
their O
own O
lot O
and O
you O
can O
park O
in O
the O
park O
nearby O
. O

I O
had O
fish B-positive
and O
my O
husband O
had O
the O
filet B-positive
- O
both O
of O
which O
exceeded O
our O
expectations O
. O

Appetizers O
took O
nearly O
an O
hour O
. O

Can O
get O
busy O
on O
Fridays O
for O
a O
table O
but O
once O
seated O
, O
the O
service B-positive
is O
so O
efficient O
you O
can O
be O
in O
and O
out O
of O
there O
quickly O
. O

To O
sum O
it O
up O
: O
Service B-neutral
varies O
from O
good O
to O
mediorce O
, O
depending O
on O
which O
waiter O
you O
get O
; O
generally O
it O
is O
just O
average O
Ok O
. O

It O
is O
simply O
amazing O
. O

So O
close O
, O
but O
not O
good O
enough O
. O

My O
son O
and O
his O
girlfriend O
both O
wanted O
cheeseburgers B-neutral
and O
they O
were O
huge O
! O

I O
had O
the O
Thai B-positive
style I-positive
Fried I-positive
Sea I-positive
Bass I-positive
... O
which O
was O
very O
good O
. O

– O
My O
first O
time O
to O
dine O
at O
this O
restaurant B-negative
was O
with O
my O
son O
and O
it O
was O
absolutely O
horrible O
! O

I O
am O
happy O
i O
did O
the O
food B-positive
was O
awsome O
. O

Their O
pad B-positive
penang I-positive
is O
delicious O
and O
everything O
else O
is O
fantastic O
. O

I O
highly O
recommend O
to O
anyone O
to O
give O
this O
place B-positive
a O
try O

Logic O
behind O
that O
? O

Best O
. O
Sushi B-positive
. O
Ever O
. O

It O
doesn't O
look O
appetizing O
as O
it's O
covered O
in O
squid O
ink O
and O
it O
turns O
your O
lips O
and O
teeth O
black O
, O
but O
the O
taste O
was O
phenomenal O
. O

The O
farro B-positive
salad I-positive
and O
the O
mashed B-positive
yukon I-positive
potatoes I-positive
were O
also O
extremely O
tasty O
. O

Go O
to O
son O
cubano O
in O
edgewater O
nj O
instead O
. O

Really O
, O
I O
find O
it O
rather O
scandalous O
that O
such O
a O
crappy O
restaurant O
attracts O
such O
crowds--this O
, O
in O
the O
city O
of O
a O
million O
restaurants O
, O
at O
least O
9/10 O
of O
which O
are O
way O
better O
than O
this O
one O
. O

– O
How O
to O
describe O
the O
best O
sushi B-positive
in O
NYC O
: O
hmmmm O
, O
delicious O
, O
amazing O
, O
fantastic O
, O
suculent O
, O
perfect O
, O
nah O
, O
all O
of O
the O
above O
. O

Considering O
we O
were O
the O
last O
patrons O
there O
and O
it O
was O
after O
the O
closing O
time O
, O
the O
waitstaff B-positive
did O
not O
rush O
us O
at O
all O
and O
made O
us O
feel O
comfortable O
and O
relaxed O
. O

– O
This O
was O
great O
dining O
experience O
. O

This O
is O
the O
case O
at O
this O
gem O
. O

The O
Prix B-positive
Fixe I-positive
menu I-positive
is O
worth O
every O
penny O
and O
you O
get O
more O
than O
enough O
( O
both O
in O
quantity O
AND O
quality O
) O
. O

Just O
remember O
to O
dress O
a O
little O
urban-chic O
so O
you O
don O
? O
t O
look O
too O
far O
out O
of O

The O
service B-positive
is O
good O
and O
the O
resturant B-positive
is O

I O

Highly O

it O

I O
had O
my O
eyes O
on O
this O
place O
, O
promising O
myself O
I O
will O
one O
day O
' O
give O
it O
a O

The O

even O
all O
the O

ALL O
TOTALLY O

And O
really O
large O

We O
replied O
that O
we O

like O

more O
minutes O
if O
that O
was O
okay O
. O

I O
was O
there O
on O

for O
my O
birthday O

we O
had O
an O

I O
would O
highly O

Despite O
the O

be O
my O
go-to O
for O

I've O
never O

I O
think O
the O
pizza B-negative
is O
so O
overrated O
and O
was O
under O
cooked O
. O

My O
friend O
from O
Milan O
and O
myself O
were O
pleasantly O
surprised O
when O
we O
arrived O
and O
everyone O
spoke O
italian O
. O

Even O
though O
its O
good O
seafood B-positive
, O
the O
prices O
are O
too O
high O
. O

however O
, O
it's O
the O
service B-negative
that O
leaves O
a O
bad O
taste O
in O
my O
mouth O
. O

First O
off O
, O
the O
food O
came O
fast O
and O
all O
together O
:) O
i O
like O
that O
... O
i O
hate O
the O
pretentiousness O
of O
things O
coming O
in O
one O
after O
the O
other O

The O

kept O
up O
the O
feeling O

once O

of O
the O

ever O
eat O

We O
will O
definitely O
go O
back O
. O

but O
the O
service B-negative
was O
a O
bit O
slow O
. O

The O
manager B-negative
came O
to O
the O
table O
and O
said O
we O
can O
do O
what O
we O
want O
, O
so O
we O
paid O
for O
what O
we O
did O
enjoy O
, O
the O
drinks B-positive
and O
appetizers B-positive
, O
and O
walked O
out O
. O

They O
pay O
such O
detail O
to O
everything O
from O
miso B-positive
soup I-positive
to O
complex O
rolls B-positive
. O

Late O
night O
dinning O
with O
exeptional O

What O
we O
did O
do O
was O
waste O
3 O
hours O
being O
trapped O
in O
a O
table O
waiting O
and O
waiting O
for O
food O
and O
drinks O
and O
hooka O
.. O
some O

we O
never O

I O
came O
here O
for O
my O
friend's O
birthday O
and O
keep O
coming O
back O
ever O
since O
. O

Ive O
been O
to O
many O
Thai O
restaurants O
in O
Manhattan O
before O
, O
and O
Toons O
is O
by O
far O
the O
best O
Thai O
food O
Ive O
had O
( O
except O
for O
my O
mom's O
of O
course O
) O
. O

Consequently O
, O
their O
burgers B-negative
fell O
apart O
in O
their O
hands O
and O
made O
such O
a O
mess O
that O
they O
did'nt O
feel O
like O
finishing O
them O
. O

However O
, O
go O
for O
the O
ambience B-positive
, O
and O
consider O
the O
food B-neutral
just O
a O
companion O
for O
a O
trip O
across O
the O
world O
! O

It O
is O
nearly O
impossible O
to O
get O
a O
table O
, O
so O
if O
you O
ever O
have O
the O
chance O
to O
go O
here O
for O
dinner O
, O
DO O
NOT O
pass O
it O
up O
. O

This O
small O

souvlaki O
spot O
makes O
what O
many O
consider O
the O
best O

in O
New O

. O

Only O
drawback O
- O
they O
won't O
toast O
your O
bagel O
, O
and O
they O
don't O
make O
eggs O
for O
the O
bagel O
. O

Also O
, O
because O
it O
is O
so O
thin O
, O
it O
gets O
cold O
very O
quickly O
and O
its O
not O
that O
filling O
. O

Price O
no O
more O
than O
a O
Jersey O
deli O
but O
way O
better O
. O

Nice O

no O

I O

who O
shared O
the O
evening O
with O
us O
, O
our O
wonderful O

made O
the O
experience O
a O
very O
positive O
one O

10 O
! O

I O
should O
have O
thought O
to O
bring O
it O
up O

never O
expected O
the O
food B-negative
to O
be O
that O
mild O
. O

I O
have O
been O
to O
this O
place B-negative

folks O

it O

Our O

Its O
great O
if O
you O

It O
’ O

just O
you O

before O

I O
prefer O

It's O
a O
great O

people O
watch O
. O

Bison B-positive
was O
quite O
excellent O
however O

The O

I O
don't O
like O
the O

I'd O

I O
think O
that O

This O

My O
wife O

I O
ate O
here O
earlier O
this O
week O
and O
have O
not O
stopped O
ranting O
and O
raving O
about O
the O
food B-positive

Food B-positive
was O
very O
good O
as O
well O
, O
considering O
that O
we O
tried O
the O
budget O
selection O
( O
though O
I O
wish O
the O
pork B-negative
belly I-negative
that O
I O
ordered O
was O
roasted O
a O

longer O

so O
that O
fat O

more O
of O
a O

We O
ate O
out O
in O
the O

which O
is O
worth O
it O
as O
it's O
cool O
and O
the O

well O
there O

I've O
been O
to O
this O
restaurant B-positive
over O
a O
dozen O
times O
with O
no O
complaints O
to O

The O
manager B-negative
finally O
said O
he O
would O
comp O
the O
two O
glasses O
of O
wine O
( O
which O
cost O
less O
than O
the O
food O
) O
, O
and O
made O
it O
seem O
like O
a O
big O
concession O
. O

This O
tiny O

as O
cozy O
as O
it O
gets O

with O
that O
certain O

The O

often O
as O
you O
can O
. O

I O
mentioned O
the O
squid O
dish O
wasn't O
very O
good O
when O
the O
waitress O
visited O
. O

The O
staff B-positive
there O
is O
very O
attentive O
and O
down O
to O
earth O
. O

While O
the O
ambiance B-positive
and O

were O
great O
, O
the O
food B-negative

could O
have O
been O
a O

There's O
another O
girl B-negative
who O
I O
can't O
describe O
, O
she O
is O
about O
5 O
' O

" O
with O
brown O
hair O

who O
eavesdrops O
on O
your O

chimes O
in O
- O
except O
she O
only O
hears O
the O
last O
part O
of O
what O
you O
said O
, O
so O
her O
uninvited O
opinions O
are O
often O
out O
of O
context O
and O
nothing O
to O
do O
with O
what O
you're O
* O
really O
* O
talking O
about O

Service B-positive
is O
top O

Untill O
this O
happens O

my O
advice O

to O
STAY O
AWAY O

believe O
us O
, O
we've O
been O
eating O
sushi O
for O
over O
15 O
yrs O

The O
only O
drawback O
is O
the O
crowded O
seating B-negative

the O
slow O
service B-negative

Immediately O
after O
we O
paid O
, O
the O
waiter B-negative
took O
the O
money O
and O
said O
, O
okay O
, O
you O
guys O
are O
outta O

Also O
very O
inexpensive O

the O

The O
food B-neutral
was O
ok O

but O
the O
service B-negative
was O
so O
poor O
that O
the O
food O
was O
cold O
buy O
the O
time O
everyone O
in O
my O
party O
was O
served O

The O

it O

I O
wanted O
to O
go O
there O
to O
see O
if O
it O
was O
worth O
it O
and O
sadly O
, O
curiousity O
got O
the O

I O
paid O
dearly O
for O
it O

that O
we O

On O
a O
recent O
Sunday O
afternoon O
, O
a O
friend O
and O
I O
accidently O
found O
this O
great O
restaurant B-positive
on O
our O
way O
to O
see O
the O
pulitzer O
prize O
winning O
play O
DOUBT O
. O

It's O
unpretentious O
and O
underground O
. O

Finally O
a O
reliable O
Chinese B-positive
restaurant I-positive
! O

Always O
a O
nice O
crowd B-positive
, O
but O
never O
loud O
. O

A O
coworker O
and O
I O
tried O
Pacifico B-positive
after O
work O
a O
few O
Fridays O
and O
loved O
it O
. O

I O
would O
go O
back O
for O
the O
wine B-positive
experience O
alone O
. O

And O
they O
give O
good O
quantity O
for O
the O
price O
. O

It O
was O
totally O
overpriced O
- O
fish B-negative
and I-negative
chips I-negative
was O
about O
$ O
15 O
... O

too O
large O
for O
just O
two O
people O
but O
nothing O
was O
left O
. O

The O
spicy B-positive
tuna I-positive
roll I-positive
was O
unusually O
good O
and O
the O
rock B-positive
shrimp I-positive
tempura I-positive
was O
awesome O
, O
great O
appetizer O
to O
share O
! O

I've O
waited O
over O
one O
hour O
for O
food O
. O

The O
food B-positive
is O
reliable O
and O
the O
price O
is O
moderate O
. O

– O
Went O
there O
last O
night O
with O
a O
friend O
. O

The O
menu O
consisted O
of O
standard O
brassiere O
food O
, O
better O
then O
places O
like O
Balthazar O
etc O
. O

But O
nonetheless--great O
spot B-positive
, O
great O
food B-positive
. O

The O
pasta B-positive
was O
well O
cooked O
, O
didn't O
have O
enough O
sauce O
though O
or O
flavor O
. O

Skip O
this O
restaurant B-negative
, O
it's O
a O
big O
disappointment O
. O

Very O
cozy O
and O
warm O
inside O
... O

Great O
food B-positive
, O
amazing O
service B-positive
, O
this O
place B-positive
is O
a O
class O
act O
. O

As O
always O
we O
had O
a O
great O
glass B-positive
of I-positive
wine I-positive
while O
we O
waited O
. O

Rather O
than O
eating O
the O
meat O
entree O
being O
offered O
, O
I O
requested O
a O
vegetarian O
dish O
. O

For O
dinner O
I O
had O
the O
chicken O
tikka-masala O
and O
some O
garlic O
naan O
. O

Everyone O
was O
smiling O
so O
that O
made O
me O
feel O
welcome O
. O

When O
the O
bill O
came O
, O
he O
only O
took O
the O
discount O
off O
the O
food O
and O
not O
the O
drinks O
. O

Mama O
Mia O
– O
I O
live O
in O
the O
neighborhood O
and O
feel O
lucky O
to O
live O
by O
such O
a O
great O
pizza B-positive
place I-positive
. O

Amazing O
Spanish B-positive
Mackeral I-positive
special I-positive
appetizer I-positive
and O
perfect O
box B-positive
sushi I-positive
( O
that O
eel B-positive
with I-positive
avodcao I-positive
- O
- O
um O
um O
um O
) O
. O

I O
just O
read O
Mocaramel's O
review O
and O
felt O
compelled O
to O
respond O
. O

Food B-positive
was O
good O
and O
appetizing O
. O

As O
it O
turns O
out O
the O
owner B-negative
was O
seated O
right O
next O
to O
us O
and O
when O
he O
came O
over O
to O
check O
on O
our O
problems O
was O
very O
dismissive O
and O
offered O
a O
token O
20 O
% O
discount O
on O
our O
bill O
. O

Keep O
up O
the O
good O
work O
guys O
! O

Great O
pizza B-positive
for O
lunch O
place O
. O

Excellent O
dumplings B-positive
served O
amid O
clean O
, O
chic O
decor B-positive
. O

Food B-neutral
was O
okay O
, O
nothing O
great O
. O

We O
were O
worried O
we O
would O
have O
trouble O
getting O
in O
, O
but O
somehow O
managed O
to O
have O
a O
short O
wait B-positive
. O

– O
This O
place B-negative
is O
unbelievably O
over-rated O
. O

Everything O
was O
going O
good O
until O
we O
got O
our O
meals B-negative
. O

The O
counter B-negative
service I-negative
is O
bad O
. O

Anyways O
, O
if O
you're O
in O
the O
neighborhood O
to O
eat O
good O
food O
, O
I O
wouldn't O
waste O
my O
time O
trying O
to O
find O
something O
, O
rather O
go O
across O
the O
street O
to O
Tamari O
. O

We O
have O
been O
to O
this O
place O
many O
times O
, O
and O
always O
have O
great O
food B-positive
, O
wine B-positive
, O
and O
service B-positive
. O

In O
fact O
, O
many O
want O
to O
return O
a O
second O
time O
during O
their O
visit O
. O

Fish B-negative
was O
overdone O
. O

not O
too O
fine O
thought O
that O
you O
feel O
uncomfortable O
and O
have O
to O
dress O
up O
. O

We O
had O
the O
lobster B-positive
sandwich I-positive
and O
it O
was O
FANTASTIC O
. O

For O
those O
of O
you O
who O
don't O
know O
, O
Uni O
is O
Sea O
Urchin O
in O
Japanese O
, O
which O
happens O
to O
be O
my O
favorite O
. O
) O

– O
I O
can't O
say O
enough O
about O
this O
place B-positive
. O

Big B-positive
Wong I-positive
is O
a O
great O
place O
to O
eat O
and O
fill O
your O
stomach O
. O

Personal B-positive
pans I-positive
are O
the O
perfect O
size O
for O
those O
hungry O
nights O
. O

Whenever O
you O
need O
a O
Sushi O
fix O
, O
Mizu O
will O
be O
there O
with O
quality O
fish B-positive
and O
great O
service B-positive
. O

I O
recommend O
the O
jelly B-positive
fish I-positive
, O
drunken B-positive
chicken I-positive
and O
the O
soupy B-positive
dumplings I-positive
, O
certainly O
the O
stir B-positive
fry I-positive
blue I-positive
crab I-positive
. O

For O
me O
dishes B-negative
a O
little O
oily O
, O
but O
overall O
dining O
experience O
good O
. O

I O
wasn't O
here O
for O
the O
pizza O
so O
I O
can't O
comment O
on O
that O
yet O
but O
what O
I O
had O
was O
very O
good O
. O

Her O
sister O
had O
the O
baklava O
for O
dessert O
! O

The O
design O
of O
the O
space B-positive
is O
good O
. O

but O
when O
we O
looked O
at O
the O
menu B-negative
, O
there O
weren't O
a O
lot O
of O
choices O
, O
most O
of O
them O
were O
dumplings O
in O
the O
appetizer O
section O
. O

The O
scallion B-neutral
pancakes I-neutral
and O
fried B-neutral
dumplings I-neutral
were O
nothing O
out O
of O
the O
ordinary O
. O

I'm O
going O
back O
. O

What O
more O
can O
you O
ask O
for O
? O

good O
sake B-positive
selection I-positive
. O

This O
place B-negative
is O
pricey O
, O
and O
yes O
, O
the O
food B-positive
is O
worth O
it O
; O
but O
the O
service B-negative
makes O
you O
feel O
like O
you O
should O
be O
paying O
a O
quater O
of O
the O
price O
. O

Thalia B-positive
is O
a O
beautiful O
restaurant O
with O
beautiful O
people B-positive
serving O
you O
, O
but O
the O
food B-negative
doesn't O
quite O
match O
up O
. O

They O
smell O
like O
they O
stuff O
them O
with O
old O
canned O
vegetables O
like O
the O
spinach O
mushroom O
calzone O
. O

THe O
Pizza B-positive
and O
wine B-positive
were O
excellent-the O
service B-positive
too--but O
what O
really O
MADE O
this O
place O
was O
the O
backyard B-positive
dining I-positive
area I-positive
. O

Great O
Pizza B-positive
, O
Poor O
Service B-negative

It's O
a O
great O
place B-positive
to O
order O
from O
or O
sit-in O
. O

THe O
perfect O
spot B-positive
. O

Good O
food B-positive
: O
my O
favorite O
is O
the O
seafood B-positive
spaghetti I-positive
. O

I O
asked O
for O
a O
menu O
and O
the O
same O
waitress B-negative
looked O
at O
my O
like O
I O
was O
insane O
. O

They O
even O
scoop O
it O
out O
nice O
( O
for O
those O
on O
a O
diet O
) O
not O
too O
much O
not O
to O
little O
. O

The O
regular B-neutral
menu I-neutral
here O
is O
slightly O
above O
average O
that O
is O
not O
worth O
the O
snotty O
attitude O
that O
you O
receive O
. O

If O
you're O
going O
to O
see O
Danny O
Gans O
or O
just O
staying O
at O
the O
Mirage O
, O
don't O
miss O
this O
one O
. O

– O
My O
husband O
and O
I O
love O
eating O
at O
Mioposto B-positive
Café I-positive
. O

I O
was O
one O
of O
the O
people O
that O
went O
for O
this O
horrible O
experience O
. O

I O
went O
home O
& O
looked O
them O
up O
online O
again O
where O
I O
discovered O
there O
is O
a O
link O
for O
a O
give O
away O
that O
doesn't O
work O
so O
emailed O
the O
restaurant B-negative
about O
the O
non O
existent O
service O
& O
deceptive O
link O
. O

Service B-positive
was O
quick O
. O

I O
went O
there O
in O
late O
afternoon O
for O
some O
bite O
size O
food O
and O
refleshment O
with O
my O
date O
. O

Delivery B-positive
is O
fast O
too O
. O

Excellent O
spot B-positive
for O
holiday O
get O
togethers O
with O
co-workers O
or O
friends O
that O
you O
haven't O
seen O
in O
a O
while O
. O

Got O
a O
date O
? O
Go O
here O
! O

The O
service O
was O
attentive O
, O
yet O
unimposing O
, O
the O
food O
was O
far O
better O
than O
many O
notorious O
restaurants O
in O
Midtown O
and O
the O
wine O
list O
is O
extensive O
and O
well O
priced O
. O

On O
weekends O
, O
you O
might O
have O
to O
wait O
for O
couple O
hours O
. O

I O
will O
go O
back O
to O
Suan B-positive
soon O
! O

All O
considered O
, O
I O
have O
to O
say O
that O
Ray's B-positive
Boathouse I-positive
is O
deserving O
of O
its O
title O
as O
a O
Seattle O
institution O
. O

Not O
a O
very O
fancy O
place B-neutral
but O
very O
good O
Chinese B-positive
style I-positive
Indian I-positive
food I-positive
. O

The O
food B-positive
was O
exceptional O
. O

Restaurants O
in O
manhattan O
should O
try O
to O
model O
food O
and O
service O
after O
this O
place O
. O

I'm O
not O
even O
going O
to O
bother O
to O
describe O
it O
; O
it O
speaks O
for O
itself O
. O

Don't O
waste O
money O
on O
decor B-neutral
. O

Food B-positive
was O
good O
and O
cheap O
. O

They O
are O
extremely O
rude O
, O
not O
even O
apologizing O
for O
the O
horrible O
service B-negative
we O
got O
and O
handing O
us O
a O
bill O
well O
over O
$ O
500 O
for O
some O

Overall O
, O
excellent O
restaurant B-positive

sometimes O
i O
get O
good O
food B-positive
and O
ok O

All O
in O
all O
, O
the O
food B-positive
was O
great O
( O
except O
for O
the O
dessserts B-negative

. O

I O
loved O
this O
place B-positive

Which O

has O
one O
of O
the O
best O
jukebox's B-positive
i've O
seen O
in O
a O
long O
long O
time O

The O
pancakes B-positive
were O
certainly O
inventive O
but O
$ O
8.50 O
for O
3 O

one O

) O
in O
the O
pancake O
flight O
( O
sample O
of O
3 O
different O
pancakes O

is O
well O
over-priced O
. O

The O
pasta B-negative
penne I-negative
was O
pretty O
extra O
buttery O
, O
creamy O
which O
means O
a O
big O
task O
to O
diggest O
.. O
tasty O
at O
first O
but O
i O
would O
say O
that O
i O
was O
full O
with O
a O
slice O
of O
pizza O
and O
7 O
to O
count O
, O

this O

However O
, O
once O
I O
received O
my O
predictably O
mediocre O
order O
of O
what O
Dokebi O

passes O
as O
Korean B-negative
fair I-negative
, O
( O
sometimes O
you O

your O
only O
option O
) O
, O
I O
got O
through O
about O
half O
my O

I O
found O
a O

lettuce O
accompanied O
by O
a O
far O
more O
disgusting O
, O
slimy O
, O
clearly O
bad O
piece O
of O

We O
were O
greeted O
promptly O
by O
the O
waiter B-positive
who O
was O
very O
nice O
and O
cordial O

I O
had O
a O
grat O
time O
at O

Good O

The O
open B-positive
sesame I-positive
combo I-positive
plate I-positive
is O
a O
bargain O
for O
the O
heap O
of O
food O
given O

– O
Ray's O
is O
THE O
place O
to O
go O
for O
high O
quality O
seafood B-positive
dinners I-positive

I O
had O
a O
huge O
group O
for O
my O
birthday O
and O
we O
were O
well O
taken O
care O
of O
. O

The O
space B-negative
kind O
of O
feels O
like O
an O
Alice O
in O
Wonderland O
setting O
, O
without O
it O
trying O
to O
be O
that O

Surprisingly O
nothing O

from O
the O

Molto O

Best O
Taiwanese B-positive
food I-positive

Management B-negative
should O
really O
take O
notice O
and O
train O
their O
waitstaff B-negative
and O
teach O
them O
some O
proper O
manners O
. O

But O
Im O
sure O
this O
was O
just O
an O
honest O
mistake O
... O

For O
my O
entrée O
, O
I O
completely O
enjoyed O
the O
seared B-positive
Alaskan I-positive
sea I-positive
scallops I-positive
complemented O
by O
chard O
, O
artichoke O
hearts O
, O
fennel O

and O
pecorino O
toscano O

The O
atmosphere B-neutral
was O
just O
okay O
. O

first O
it O
took O
us O
a O
long O
time O
to O
find O
the O

A O
weakness O
is O
the O
chicken B-negative
in I-negative
the I-negative

Once O
for O

once O

Unhygienic O

have O
been O
several O
occasions O
when O
we've O
just O
not O

The O
food B-negative

the O
Thai B-negative
fusion I-negative
stuff I-negative
is O
a O
bit O
too O
sweet O
, O
every O
thing O
they O
serve O
is O
too O
sweet O
here O

I O
lOVE O
THIS O
PLACE B-positive

Also O
, O
don't O
plan O
on O
asking O
for O
your O

if O
it's O

on O
the O

you O

so O
delicious O

Doesn't O
get O
any O
better O
than O
that O
. O

When O
we O
sat O
, O
we O
got O
great O
and O
fast O
service B-positive

I O
live O
in O

and O
am O
a O
regular O
. O

skip O

I O
go O
out O

never O
rush O
courses O
or O
force O
another O
drink O
. O

I O
almost O
hesititate O
to O
write O
a O
review O
because O
the O
atmosphere B-positive
was O
so O
great O
and O
I O
would O
hate O
for O
it O
too O
become O
to O
crowded O
. O

Will O
definitely O
be O
back O
. O

The B-positive
Four I-positive
Seasons I-positive
restaurant I-positive
is O
a O
great O
experience O
. O

Without O
the O
wait O
or O
attitude O
, O
I O
would O
probably O
go O
back O
, O
but O
there O
are O
just O
too O
many O
other O
restaurants O
in O
Brooklyn O
that O
are O
as O
good O
or O
better O
and O
don't O
make O
me O
jump O
through O

Wish O

had O
more O
of O
these O

intimate O

superb O

homey O

all O

good O

Hydes I-positive
t O

one O
of O
those O
places O
that O
is O
fun O
to O
do O
once O
. O

Everything O
you O
want O
and O
more O
, O
very O
fresh O

The O
workers O
there O
also O
absolutely O
load O
the O
bagel B-negative
with O
cream O
cheese O
( O
gets O
a O
little O
messy O
) O
. O

I O
had O
to O
ask O
her O
three O
times O
before O
she O
finally O
came O
back O
with O
the O
dish O
Ive O
requested O
. O

My O
chicken B-negative
was O
inedible O
as O
there O
were O
so O
many O
fatty O
lumps O
which O
i O
had O
to O
keep O
spitting O
out O
into O
my O
napkin O

We O
were O

The O

If O
you O
want O
good O
authentic O

this O
place O
is O
not O
the O
place O
to O
go O
. O

For O
authentic O
Thai B-positive
food I-positive
, O
look O
no O
further O
than O
Toons O

The O
atmosphere B-positive
was O
great O

Waitstaff B-positive

Having O
hunted O
around O
for O
a O
quiet O
, O
romantic O
, O
yet O
not O
hideously O
expensive O
restaurant O
I O
stumbled O
across O
reviews O
for O
La O
Lanterna O
and O
gave O
it O
a O
shot O
. O

I O
went O
here O
on O
a O
recommendation O
and O
will O
surely O
return O
time O
and O
time O
again O
. O

Frankly O
, O
when O
you O
compare O
what O
you O
can O
have O
here O
for O
lunch O
, O
versus O
McDs O
or O
so O
many O
other O

there O
is O
no O

On O
our O
last O
visit O

they O
skipped O
over O
our O
name O
on O
the O
list O
, O
leaving O
us O
waiting O
an O
extra O
hour O
for O
a O
table O
. O

I O
sometimes O
see O
the O
waiters O
don't O
have O
enough O
knowledge O
of O
their O
dishes O
. O

Then O
, O
to O
top O
things O
off O
, O
she O
dropped O
used O
silverware O
on O
my O
boyfriend's O
jacket O
and O
did O
not O
stop O
to O
apologize O
or O
clean O
the O
mess O
that O
was O
left O
on O
clothes O
. O

Try O
the O
sea B-positive
bass I-positive
. O

Nice O
value O
. O

We O
picked O
it O
randomly O
, O
without O
a O
recommendation O
from O
someone O
who O
has O
been O
there O
, O
so O
we O
weren't O
sure O
what O
to O
expect O
. O

The O
view B-positive
is O
breathtaking O
the O
service B-positive
is O
top O
notch O
... O
the O
ambiance B-positive
is O
wonderfull O
. O

To O
the O
owners O
of O
Open B-positive
Sesame I-positive
... O
Bravo O
... O
I O
can't O
wait O
to O
come O
back O
to O
dine O
at O
your O
restaurant O
! O

I O
liked O
the O
atmosphere B-positive
very O
much O
but O
the O
food B-negative
was O
not O
worth O
the O
price O
. O

I O
tried O
a O
couple O
other O
dishes B-neutral
but O
wasn't O
too O
impressed O
. O

Good O
eats B-positive
. O

The O
fish B-negative
was O
adequate O
, O
but O
inexpertly O
sliced O
. O

Mine O
tasted O
like O
the O
bartender O
had O
forgotten O
to O
add O
the O
tequila O
. O

Should O
have O
gone O
to O
Trader O
Joe's O
and O
had O
frozen O
pizza O
:( O

Dessert B-negative
is O
a O
joke O
... O
dont O
bother O

Would O
NEVER O
go O
back O
there O
. O

A O
fairly O
late O
entry O
into O
the O
haute O
barnyard O
sweepstakes O
, O
Flatbush O
Farm O
isn't O
in O
the O
same O
league O
as O
the O
Blue O
Hills O
or O
even O
the O
Farm O
on O
Adderlys O
of O
the O
world O
, O
but O
it's O
pretty O
good O
, O
albeit O
with O
a O
somewhat O
dismal O
setting O
. O

The O
decor B-positive
is O
very O
simple O
but O
comfortable O
. O

The O
only O
drawback O
is O
that O
this O
place B-negative
is O
really O
expensive O
and O
the O
portions B-negative
are O
on O
the O
small O
side O
. O

The O
service B-positive
was O
quick O
and O
friendly O
. O

Either O
that O
, O
or O
the O
editor's O
idea O
of O
romance O
must O
be O
sharing O
a O
conversation O
with O
the O
next O
table O
, O
while O
trying O
to O
speak O
louder O
than O
the O
traffic O
on O
57th O
. O

the O
last O
time O
i O
walked O
by O
it O
looked O
pretty O
empty O
. O
hmmm O
. O

The O
appetizer B-positive
of I-positive
oysters I-positive
, I-positive
lobster I-positive
, I-positive
crab I-positive
( I-positive
small I-positive
size I-positive
) I-positive
made O
a O
perfect O
entre O
for O
my O
wife O
. O

Definitely O
worth O
the O
trip O
to O
Battery O
Park O
City O
! O

The O
vibe B-positive
is O
very O
relaxed O
and O
cozy O
, O
service B-positive
was O
great O
and O
the O
food B-positive
was O
excellent O
! O

Good O
luck O
getting O
a O
table O
. O

not O
chewy O
at O
all O
. O

The O
sake B-positive
menu I-positive
should O
not O
be O
overlooked O
! O

I O
would O
recommend O
to O
ask O
for O
a O
bigger O
sitting O
area O
when O
you O
make O
a O
reservation O
( O
if O
possible O
) O

Highly O
recommended O
to O
all O
! O

They O
honored O
reservation O
on O
Sunday O
afternoon O
very O
well O
. O

The O
porcini B-negative
mushroom I-negative
pasta I-negative
special I-negative
was O
tasteless O
, O
so O
was O
the O
seafood B-negative
tagliatelle I-negative
. O

I O
go O
twice O
a O
month O
! O

This O
place B-positive
has O
got O
to O
be O
the O
best O
japanese O
restaurant O
in O
the O
new O
york O
area O
. O

I O
can't O
believe O
people O
complain O
about O
no O
cheese O
sticks O
? O

We O
took O
advanatage O
of O
the O
half B-positive
price I-positive
sushi I-positive
deal I-positive
on O
saturday O
so O
it O
was O
well O
worth O
it O
. O

– O
In O
a O
age O
of O
incremental O
cost O
cutting O
in O
restaurants O
, O
its O
nice O
to O
see O
a O
place O
that O
bucks O
that O
trend O
, O
and O
just O
plain O
delivers O
high O
quality O
food B-positive
and O
good O
service B-positive
, O
period O
. O

Been O
there O
, O
done O
that O
, O
and O
New O

, O
it's O
not O
that O
big O
a O
deal O
. O

We O
were O
charged O
full O
price O
. O

We O
weren't O
! O

Finally O
a O
meal B-positive
that O
you O
will O
remember O
for O
a O
long O
time O
! O

I O
have O
been O
to O

The O

about O
the O

The O

was O
very O
good O
, O
filet B-positive

was O
probably O
the O
best O
I've O
ever O
try O
. O

The O
portions B-neutral
are O
big O
though O
, O
so O
do O
not O
order O
too O
much O
. O

From O
the O
street O
it O
looks O
very O
hidden O
, O
and O
is O
actually O
an O
old O
warehouse O
. O

I O
had O
the O
Kafta B-positive
plate I-positive
and O
it O
was O
perfect O
. O

The O
waitress O
appeared O
and O
asked O
us O
if O
we O
wanted O
to O
go O
ahead O
and O
order O
. O

Ahhh O
... O

The O
most O
pleasant O
surprise O
was O
the O
check O
that O
did O
not O
exceed O
my O
expectations O
as O
it O
always O
happens O
in O
most O
of O
the O
places O
. O

We O
had O
Pam's B-positive

fried I-positive
fish I-positive
and O
it O
was O
amazing O
. O

MMMMMMMMMmmmmmm O

to I-positive
fish I-positive
ration I-positive
was O
also O
good--they O
didn't O
try O
to O
overpack O
the O

If O
you O
ware O
looking O

I O
suggest O
you O
try O
some O
of O
the O

This O
is O
a O
great O
place B-positive
to O

– O
The O
atmosphere B-positive
is O
great O
for O
any O
special O
occasion O
you O
might O
want O
to O
celebrate O
. O

The O
rolls B-positive
are O
creative O
and O
I O
have O
yet O
to O
find O
another O

place O
that O
serves O
up O
more O
inventive O
yet O
delicious O
japanese B-positive
food I-positive
. O

Was O
there O
Friday O

I O
would O
defiantly O
come O
back O

I O
have O
been O

I O
have O
to O
say O
I O
love O
to O
go O
out O
and O
explore O
the O
scene O
. O

I O
recommend O
this O
place B-positive
to O
everyone O
. O

The O
only O
thing O
that O
my O
friend O
left O
out O
is O
that O
when O
we O
sat O
down O
at O
the O
bar O
the O
bartender B-negative
disappeared O
. O

It O
costs O
$ O
2 O
extra O
to O
turn O
a O

into O
an O

, O
but O
the O

more O
than O
triples O
in O
size O
, O
and O
that's O
not O
just O
from O

At O
this O
point O
, O
the O
waitress B-negative
comes O
over O
and O
asks O
us O
if O
everything O
was O
okay O
, O
I O
was O
literally O
so O
shocked O
that O
I O
was O
speechless O
and O
didn't O
say O
anything O
, O
and O
guess O
what O
, O
the O
waitress O
WALKED O
away O
. O

im O
not O
necessarily O
fanatical O
about O
this O
place B-positive
, O
but O
it O
was O
a O
fun O
time O
for O
low O
pirces O
. O

All O
in O
all O
the O
food B-positive
was O
good O
- O
a O
little O
on O
the O
expensive O
side O
, O
but O
fresh O
. O

plus O
, O
i O
am O
allergic O
to O
rice O
, O
and O
the O
waitstaff B-positive
was O
unbelievably O
accomodating O
- O
- O
didn't O
even O
bat O
an O
eye O
! O

The O
food B-neutral
is O
okay O
and O
the O
prices O
here O
are O
mediocre O
. O

Although O
we O
were O
told O
10-15 O
minutes O
and O
it O
was O
more O
like O
45 O
minutes O
. O

However O
, O
most O
of O
them O
are O
at O
least O
prompt O
and O
pleasant O
. O

The O
sauce B-negative
tasted O
more O
like O
Chinese O
fast O
food O
than O
decent O
Korean O
. O

Very O
pleased O

We O
had O
a O
good O
time O
. O

This O
little O
place B-positive
definitely O
exceeded O
my O
expectations O
and O
you O
sure O
get O
a O
lot O
of O
food B-positive
for O
your O
money O
. O

This O
is O
such O
a O
lovely O
, O
peaceful O
place B-positive
to O
eat O
outside O

The O
menu B-positive
looked O
great O
, O
and O
the O
waiter B-positive
was O
very O
nice O
, O
but O
when O
the O
food B-neutral
came O
, O
it O
was O
average O
. O

Nice O
ambience B-positive

but O
highly O
overrated O
place B-negative

Some O
of O
the O
food O
is O
clearly O
oriented O
toward O
foodies O
( O
like O
me O

so O
if O
your O
not O
a O
foodie O
( O
nothing O
wrong O
with O

- O
head O
over O
to O
McDonalds O

our O
sushi B-negative

pretty O
below O

the O

I O
experience O

The O
hostess B-negative
was O
rude O
and O
I O
got O
a O
distinct O
feeling O
that O
they O
did O
not O
want O
to O
serve O
us O
. O

I O
loved O
it O
and O
would O
go O
again O
. O

Food B-positive

usually O

ocasionally O
I O
wondered O

Not O
the O

extremely O

attentive O
( O

but O
I O
barely O
understood O
1 O
word O
when O
the O
waiter B-negative
took O
our O
order O
. O

Guess O
what O
, O
I O
waited O
for O
TWENTY O
minutes O
before O
she O
came O
over O
and O
when O
she O
finally O
did O
, O
she O
says O
, O
" O
oh O
well O
, O
I O
wish O
you O
would O
have O
said O
something O
earlier O
" O
No O
apology O

nothing O

I O
went O
there O
with O

And O
I O
hate O
to O
say O
this O
but O
I O
doubt O
I'll O
ever O
go O
back O

Two O
complaints O
- O
their O
appetizer B-negative

stinks O

it O
would O
be O
nice O
to O
get O
some O
mozzarella O

You O
will O
find O
yourself O

Awesome O

The O

selection O
of O
bruschettas B-positive

paninis B-positive
, O
tramezzinis B-positive
keep O
the O
palate O
from O
stagnating O

We've O
found O
it O
to O
be O
better O
and O
fresher O
than O
Kiku O
which O
is O
comparable O
in O
price O
. O

We O
arrived O

were O

made O
us O
both O

and O
can't O
seem O
to O
find O
a O
great O
Italian O

drive O
to O
Corona B-positive

Nothing O
really O
came O
across O
as O
outstanding O
. O

I O
was O
shocked O
that O
my O
friends O
wanted O
to O
stay O
after O
the O
waitress B-negative
said O
, O
" O
can O
I O
help O
you O
" O
and O
" O
how O
many O
are O
in O
your O
party O
. O
" O

Oh O
I O
forgot O
to O
mention O
that O
they O
don't O
have O
bread O
service O
. O

The O
rice B-negative
was O
poor O
quality O
and O
was O
cooked O
so O
badly O
it O
was O
hard O
. O

The O
setting B-positive
is O
casual O
and O
romantic O

i O
know O
, O
you O
were O
too O
busy O
showing O
off O
your O
vintage O
tee O

looking O
bored O
, O
but O
my O
agenda O
is O
i'm O
here O
to O
eat O
and O
enjoy O
the O
company O
of O
friends O
, O
seeking O
a O
pleasant O
experience O
. O

The O
atmosphere B-positive
is O
relaxed O
and O
casual O
. O

And O
even O
more O
so O
unpleasant O
because O
it O
was O
so O
costly O
for O
such O
an O
unpleasant O
experience O
. O

The O
presentation O
of O
Snooze B-positive
is O
excellent O
and O
it O
is O
one O
of O
those O
places O
that O
you O
feel O
more O
sophisticated O
just O
for O
being O
there O
; O
but O
peel O
back O
the O
layers O
and O
you O
have O
an O
overpriced O
IHOP O
with O
a O
high O
brow O
menu B-negative
. O

I O
highly O
recommend O
this O
beautiful O
place B-positive

Price O
is O
high O
but O
the O
food B-positive

good O
, O
so O
I O
would O
come O
back O
again O

Service B-positive

fast O

I O
would O
never O
recommend O
this O
place B-negative

anybody O
even O
for O
a O
casual O
dinner O

The O
food B-negative
is O
not O
what O
it O
once O
was O
( O
potions B-negative
have O
seriously O
seen O
downsizing O
) O
prices O
have O
gone O
up O
, O
and O
the O
service B-negative
is O
the O
worst O
I O
have O
experienced O
anywhere O
( O
including O
mainland O
Europe O
) O
. O

I O
have O
worked O
in O
restaurants O
and O
cook O
a O

there O
is O
no O

be O
able O

Food B-positive

some O
