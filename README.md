Sentiment analysis system for social media text

In this design project, we would like to design our sequence labelling model for informal texts using the hidden Markov model (HMM). The sequence labelling system for informal texts can serve as the very first step towards building a more complex, intelligent sentiment
analysis system for social media text.

Algorithms implemented include the Viterbi algorithm, alternative max-marginal decoding algorithm, and a modified Perceptron algorithm.
