when O
i O
called O
this O
morning O
, O
i O
didn't O
think O
i O
would O
be O
able O
to O
get O
in O
at O
12 O
, O
but O
i O
was O
able O
to O
get O
in O
, O
along O
with O
four O
other O
guests O
. O

the O
tuna B-positive
and I-positive
wasabe I-positive
potatoes I-positive
are O
excellent O
. O

my O
favortie O
pizza B-positive
joint O
in O
seattle O

food B-positive
wise O
, O
its O
ok O
but O
a O
bit O
pricey O
for O
what O
you O
get O
considering O
the O
restaurant O
isn't O
a O
fancy O
place O
. O

– O
tucked O
away O
over O
by O
the O
beverly O
center O
. O

my O
mouth O
felt O
very O
dry O
afterwards O
and O
i O
had O
that O
signature O
? O
msg O
? O
taste O
lingering O
in O
my O
throat O
after O
i O
left O
the O
restaurant O
. O

it's O
a O
tiny O
place O
so O
if O
you O
get O
there O
before O
8p O
m O
on O
a O
weekend O
( O
thurs O
? O
sun O
) O
you O
will O
find O
it O
easier O
to O
get O
a O
table O
or O
a O
seat O
at O
the O
sushi B-positive
bar I-positive
. O

the O
wine B-positive
list I-positive
is O
wonderful O
and O
the O
food B-positive
reminds O
me O
of O
my O
recent O
trip O
to O
italy O
. O

we O
all O
agreed O
that O
mare O
is O
one O
of O
the O
best O
seafood B-positive
restaurants O
in O
new O
york O
. O

believe O
it O
baby O
! O

we O
have O
since O
returned O
and O
also O
had O
a O
great O
experience O
, O
sampling O
more O
small O
plates O
and O
a O
variety O
of O
the O
beer O
( O
cold O
and O
good O
) O
. O

compared O
to O
ess-a O
, O
tal O
offers O
a O
less O
doughy O
bagel O
! O

it O
was O
so O
much O
though O
that O
i O
could O
barely O
finish O
but O
i O
did O
, O
since O
it O
was O
delicious O
. O

the O
staff B-positive
was O
very O
nice O
and O
courteous O
and O
obviously B-positive
chinese I-positive
. O

this O
was O
, O
from O
start O
to O
finish O
, O
a O
mind-bogglingly O
uncomfortable O
experience O
. O

i O
went O
here O
with O
a O
friend O
on O
a O
whim O
, O
we O
went O
someplace O
else O
first O
and O
couldn't O
get O
a O
table O
. O

we O
concluded B-positive
with I-positive
tiramisu I-positive
chocolate I-positive
cake I-positive
, O
both O
were O
delicious O
. O

not O
much O
of O
a O
selection B-positive
of I-positive
bottled I-positive
beer I-positive
either O
, O
we O
went O
with O
brahma O
. O

– O
this O
review O
is O
for O
the O
southglen O
location O
which O
is O
not O
listed O
in O
citysearch O
: O
i O
wish O
this O
review O
would O
make O
a O
difference O
enough O
for O
it O
to O
be O
addressed O
by O
management B-negative
but O
snooze O
has O
people O
climbing O
over O
each O
other O
for O
a O
chance O
to O
eat O
at O
this O
overpriced O
restaurant O
with O
mediocre O
food B-positive
and O
service B-positive
, O
so O
this O
review O
as O
well O
as O
the O
other O
negative O
ones O
for O
their O
larimer O
location O
will O
go O
unaddressed O
. O

i'll O
be O
back O
for O
sure O
. O

good O
experience O

the O
lox O
is O
always O
fresh O
too O
. O

although O
we O
were O
looking O
for O
regular O
lettuce O
and O
some O
walnuts O
the O
salads B-positive
we O
got O
were O
great O
. O

we've O
tried O
before O
but O
it O
always O
packed O
and O
doesn't O
take O
reservations O
. O

beautiful O
experience O
. O

good O
drink O
. O

there O
is O
" O
expensive-but-worth-it O
" O
and O
there O
is O
" O
expensive-and-wtf O
" O
? O

and O
it O
was O
quick O
which O
is O
very O
important O
. O

this O
little O
place O
has O
a O
cute O
interior O
decor B-positive
and O
affordable O
city O
prices O
. O

the O
location O
and O
ambience B-positive
is O
ok O
but O
the O
food B-positive
is O
what O
makes O
up O
for O
it O
. O

i O
literally O
just O
got O
back O
home O
after O
visiting O
casa B-negative
la I-negative
femme I-negative
and O
was O
so O
offended O
by O
my O
visit O
felt O
it O
necessary O
to O
try O
and O
warn O
other O
diners O
who O
value O
their O
money O
and O
time O
. O

the O
place O
itself O
is O
beautiful O
the O
bar O
scene B-positive
seems O
to O
be O
happening O
. O

also O
, O
the O
sandwiches O
( O
nearing O
$ O
7 O
) O
didn't O
come O
with O
anything O
like O
chips O
or O
a O
side O
. O

the O
stuff O
tilapia O
was O
horrid O
... O
tasted O
like O
cardboard O
. O

you O
can O
easily O
hear O
him O
though O
so O
it O
was O
a O
pleasant O
sound O
and O
not O
overbearing O
. O

it's O
definately O
not O
a O
place O
to O
go O
if O
you O
want O
to O
impress O
someone O
. O

the O
lamb B-positive
was O
tender O
so O
full O
of O
flavor O
, O
the O
dessert B-negative
was O
divine O
! O
! O

great O
vibe B-positive
, O
lots O
of O
people O
. O

to O
start O
things O
off O
, O
our O
lovely O
server B-positive
brooke O
was O
quickly O
on O
hand O
to O
take O
my O
drink O
order O
. O

we O
refused O
to O
pay O
for O
it O
because O
at O
this O
point O
it O
had O
nothing O
to O
do O
with O
the O
food B-positive
anymore O
. O

the O
naan O
was O
some O
of O
the O
best O
i've O
had O
and O
i O
really O
enjoyed O
the O
bhartha O
, O
not O
too O
tomatoey O
. O

fabulous O
food B-positive
- O
if O
the O
front B-negative
of I-negative
house I-negative
staff I-negative
don't O
put O
you O
off O
– O

single O
worst O
restaurant O
in O
manhattan O

inside O
is O
a O
little O
cramped O
, O
but O
to O
be O
expected O
. O

however O
, O
they O
do O
take O
your O
cellphone O
numbers O
so O
that O
you O
can O
go O
hang O
out O
somewhere O
else O
till O
they O
call O
you O
up O
on O
your O
cellphone O
. O

go O
to O
japanese O
sushi B-positive
place I-positive
or O
spanish O
tapas O
place O
- O
this O
creation O
in O
williamsburg O
is O
a O
misstake O
. O

not O
one O
to O
jump O
to O
complaints O
( O
hence O
my O
lack O
of O
previous O
online O
reviewing O
) O
, O
i O
called O
the O
restaurant O
to O
give O
them O
a O
heads O
up O
that O
their O
kitchen O
might O
want O
to O
check O
the O
cleanliness O
of O
their O
prep O
stations O
. O

i'm O
glad O
i O
was O
introduced O
to O
this O
place O
and O
this O
is O
a O
rare O
gem O
in O
ny O
. O

it's O
a O
rather O
cramped O
and O
busy O
restaurant O
and O
it O
closes O
early O
. O

the O
food B-positive
is O
fantastic O
, O
authentic O
, O
delicious O
and O
very O
, O
very O
affordable O
. O

mmm O
... O
good O
! O

but O
$ O
500 O
for O
a O
dinner O
for O
two O
that O
didn't O
include O
wine B-positive
? O

the O
staff B-positive
offers O
impeccable O
service B-positive
. O

great O
indian B-positive
food I-positive
! O

– O
as O
with O
most O
restaurants O
in O
seattle O
, O
mioposto's O
service B-positive
was O
bad O
and O
the O
food B-positive
was O
overpriced O
. O

great O
draft O
and O
bottle B-positive
selection I-positive
and O
the O
pizza B-positive
rocks O
. O

we O
went O
to O
ino O
for O
valentines O
. O

the O
wait O
staff B-positive
is O
pleasant O
, O
fun O
, O
and O
for O
the O
most O
part O
gorgeous O
( O
in O
the O
wonderful O
aesthetic O

way O
, O
not O
in O
that O
she's-way-cuter-than-me-that-b O
@ O
# O
$ O
* O
way O
) O
. O

there O
is O
something O
about O
their O
atmosphere B-positive
that O
makes O
me O
come O
back O
nearly O
every O
week O
. O

the O
last O
two O
times O
i O
ordered O
from O
here O
my O
food B-positive
was O
soo O
spicy O
that O
i O
could O
barely O
eat O
it O
, O
and O
the O
spice O
took O
away O
from O
the O
flavor O
of O
the O
dish O
. O

quite O
frankly O
, O
this O
is O
some O
of O
the O
worst O
sushi B-positive
i O
have O
ever O
tried O
. O

if O
i O
could O
give O
0 O
stars O
i O
would O
do O
so O
for O
this O
place O
. O

i O
have O
never O
before O
eaten O
40 O
pieces O
of O
relatively O
good O
nigiri O
. O

when O
family O
came O
in O
he O
gave O
them O
apps O
to O
test O
their O
palets O
, O
and O
then O
ordered O
for O
them O
. O

with O
the O
exception O
of O
our O
lemon B-positive
salad I-positive
that O
had O
so O
much O
pepper O
on O
it O
that O
our O
eyes O
started O
watering O
, O
the O
food B-positive
here O
was O
decent O
, O
not O
great O
. O

what O
a O
great O
place O
. O

my O
friend O
is O
100 O
% O
right O
in O
the O
experience O
we O
had O
. O

the O
rest O
of O
the O
dim B-positive
sum I-positive
, O
though O
pricey O
by O
chinatown O
standards O
, O
is O
worth O
it O
. O

much O
of O
the O
time O
it O
seems O
like O
they O
do O
not O
care O
about O
you O
. O

best O
in O
all O
of O
nyc O

trust O
me O
. O

and O
where O
does O
patis O
go O
wrong O
; O
no O
where O
. O

this O
is O
undoubtedly O
my O
favorite O
modern B-positive
japanese I-positive
brasserie I-positive
( I-positive
that O
don O
’ O
t O
serve O
sushi B-positive
) O
, O
and O
in O
my O
opinion O
, O
one O
of O
the O
most O
romantic O
restaurants O
in O
the O
city O
! O

my O
husband O
said O
he O
could've O
eaten O
several O
more O
, O
the O
portion O
was O
fine O
for O
me O
he O
even O
exclaimed O
that O
the O
french B-positive
fries O
were O
the O
best O
he O
has O
had O
. O

we O
asked O
for O
sides O
which O
the O
waiter B-negative
than O
admitted O
that O
he O
forgot O
to O
put O
in O
that O
part O
of O
our O
order O
. O

i O
am O
bringing O
my O
whole O
family O
back O
next O
time O
. O

these O
are O
overpriced O
and O
you O
can O
get O
better O
just O
around O
the O
corner O
: O

after O
dinner O
the O
manager B-negative
grabbed O
my O
boyfriend O
, O
asked O
him O
: O
where O
are O
you O
from O
... O
maybe O
you O
dont O
know O
how O
things O
work O
in O
america O
... O
and O
in O
the O
end O
stormed O
away O
almost O
teareyed O
yelling O
that O
tips O
are O
the O
only O
thing O
they O
survive O
on O
. O

it O
was O
well O
worth O
the O
wait O
. O

my O
husband O
and O
i O
thougt O
it O
would O
be O
great O
to O
go O
to O
the O
jekyll O
and O
hyde O
pub O
for O
our O
anniversary O
, O
and O
to O
our O
surprise O
it O
was O
fantastic O
. O

my O
wife O
had O
the O
fried B-neutral
shrimp I-neutral
which O
are O
huge O
and O
loved O
it O
. O

i O
stumbled O
upon O
this O
great O
pizzeria O
as O
i O
explored O
my O
new O
neighborhood O
. O

it O
? O
s O
served O
with O
either O
a O
peppercorn O
sauce O
or O
red B-positive
wine I-positive
reduction I-positive
, O
though O
both O
were O
indistinguishable O
in O
taste O
. O

the O
food B-positive
was O
absolutely O
amazing O
! O
! O

we O
put O
out O
name O
down O
and O
although O
there O
were O
open O
tables O
we O
were O
told O
that O
it'd O
be O
a O
30 O
minute O
wait O
. O

i O
do O
not O
think O
dinner O
in O
manhattan O
should O
cost O
$ O
400.00 O
where O
i O
am O
not O
swept O
off O
my O
feet O

lobster B-positive
was O
good O
, O
nothing O
spectacular O
. O

i O
actually O
feel O
like O
i O
should O
keep O
it O
a O
secret O
. O

very O
disappointed O
. O

try O
the O
congee O
and O
the O
donut O
like O
deep B-positive
fried I-positive
dough I-positive
they O
call O
ow O
ley O

, O
a O
delicious O
and O
sweet O
tasting B-positive
bread I-positive

rather O
than O
preparing O
vegetarian O
dish O
, O
the O
chef B-negative
presented O
me O
with O
a O
plate O
of O
steamed O
vegetables B-positive
( I-positive
minus I-positive

in O
the O

up O
with O
a O
fair O

nothing O

a O
great O
time O
! O

– O
i O
am O
exceedingly O
pleased O
to O
report O
that O
my O
dinner O
at O
ray's O
boathouse O
last O
friday O
completely O
exceeded O
my O
expectations O
. O

she O
was O
very O
helpful O
in O
suggesting O
us O
drinks O
and O
helped O
us O
in O
ordering O
a O
lot O
of O
good O
dishes O
since O
we O
knew O
nothing O
about O
indian B-positive
food I-positive

went O
here O
on O
a O

their O
favorite O
types O
of O

pizza I-positive
places O

but O
mioposto's O

good O
taste O

i O
went O
there O
for O
lunch O
and O
it O
was O
not O
as O
good O
as O
i O
expected O
from O
the O
reviews O
i O
read O
. O

what O
a O
hassle O
! O

this O
place O
must O
have O
cost O
the O
owners O
afortune O
to O
build O
. O

on O
the O
way O
out O
, O
we O
heard O
of O
other O
guests O
complaining O
about O
similar O
issues O
. O

the O
portions B-positive
are O
small O
but O
being O
that O
the O
food B-positive
was O
so O
good O
makes O
up O
for O
that O
. O

we O
all O
felt O
it O
was O
worth O
it O
. O

love O
their O
drink O
menu O
. O

if O
you O
are O
going O
for O
the O
food B-positive
, O
it O
will O
not O
be O
worth O
it O
. O

service B-positive
was O
kind O
of O
slow O
, O
our O

took O
forever O
to O
give O
us O
our O
check O
even O
though O
it O
wasn't O
that O
busy O

its O
worth O
the O
wait O

especially O
since O
they'll O
give O
you O
a O
call O
when O
the O
table O
is O
ready O

i O
went O
to O

one O
would O
think O
we'd O
get O
an O
apology O
or O
complimentary O
drinks O

instead O
, O
we O
got O
a O
snobby O
waiter B-negative
wouldn't O
even O
take O
our O
order O
for O
15 O
minutes O
and O
gave O
us O
lip O
when O
we O
asked O
him O
to O
do O
so O

after O
sitting O
at O
the O
bar O
for O
over O
20 O

i've O
been O
many O

never O
been O
disappointed O

the O

we O
were O
fast O

their O

i O
thanked O
my O
friend O
who O
recommended O
me O
this O
restaurant O

will O
certainly O
recommend O
it O
to O
others O

sometimes O
you O
pay O
a O
lot O

don't O
get O
much O
in O

it's O
manhattan O

things O

the O

there O
are O
no O

the O
duck O

always O
amazing O

the O

out O

love O
dungeness O

at O

you O
can O
get O
them O

i O
probably O
wouldn't O
go O
back O

cuz O
i O
don't O

it O

the B-negative

avoid O
the O
place O

it O
was O
one O
of O
the O
few O
places O
in O
socal O
where O
you O
would O
actually O
walk O
around O
and O
not O
have O
to O
take O
a O
car O
. O

outside O
in O
the O
area O
between O
the O
restaurant O
and O
the O
park O
, O
children O
were O
running O
around O
while O
their O
parents O
sipped O
wine B-positive

i O
took O
one O
look O
at O
the O
chicken B-positive

i O
was O
appalled O
. O

great O
survice O

fresh O
restaurant O
was O
amazing O
... O
food B-positive
was O
delicious O
and O
of O
course O
fresh O
. O

i O
cannot O
imagine O
you O
not O
rushing O
out O
to O
eat O
there O
. O

even O
after O
they O
overcharged O
me O
the O
last O
time O
i O
was O
there O
. O

we O
did O
arrive O
late O
for O
our O
reservation O
so O
i O
can O
not O
complain O
too O
much O
about O
the O
wait O
for O
a O
table O
. O

i O
have O
been O
twice O
to O
this O
restaurant O
. O

the O
mussels O
were O
fantastic O
and O
so O
was O
the O
dessert B-negative
... O
definitely O
going O
to O
be O
back O
very O
soon O
. O

yes O
, O
i O
ate O
the O
food B-positive
, O
but O
i O
certainly O
would O
not O
have O
if O
i O
had O
seen O
the O
maggot O
before O
eating O
, O
and O
i O
was O
at O
this O
point O
fairly O
sick O
to O
my O
stomach O
. O

the O
place O
was O
nice O
and O
calm O
. O

i O
have O
it O
a O
4 O
instead O
of O
5 O
because O
of O
the O
price O
( O
just O
chicken B-positive
tikka I-positive
masala I-positive
- O
no O
bread O
of O
rice O
- O
is O
$ O
25 O
) O
, O
which O
i O
would O
expect O
at O
a O
upscale O
indian O
restaurant O
but O
this O
place O
doesn't O
have O
an O
upscale O
feel O
. O

our O
server B-positive
was O
very O
professional O
and O
friendly O
. O

but O
for O
the O
shabu O
shabu O
, O
you O
won't O
find O
much O
better O
in O
ny O
. O

as O
a O
student O
in O
nyu O
i O
need O
a O
place O
to O
eat O
after O
a O
hard O
day O
of O
work O
so O
usually O
i O
just O
go O
to O
any O
indian O
restraunt O
near O
by O
. O

service B-positive
here O
was O
great O
, O
food B-positive
was O
fantastic O

i O
wish O
i O
could O
be O
refunded O

the O

we O
waited O
over O
1/2 O
hour O
to O
45 O
minutes O
and O
were O
never O
offered O
a O
drink O
. O

considering O
you O
will O
spend O
at O
least O
$ O
60 O
a O
head O
, O
i O
expect O
better O
service B-positive
. O

this O
is O
the O
perfect O
spot B-positive
for O
meeting O
friends O
, O
having O
lunch O
, O
dinner O
, O
pre-theatre O
or O
after-theatre O
drinks O

there's O
nice O
and O
quiet O
, O
small O
but O
enough O
for O
6 O
( O
or O
more O
) O
. O

not O
only O
is O
it O
an O
adventure O
getting O
to O
this O
somewhat O
hidden O
spot B-positive

once O
you O
enter O
the O
unmarked O

will O

you O

no O
longer O

even O
though O
the O
place O

not O
beautiful O

i O
love O
that O
coffee B-positive

my O
girlfriend O

i O
stumbled O
onto O
this O
hopping O
place O
the O
other O
night O
and O
had O
a O
great O
time O
! O

indoor O
was O
very O
cozy O
and O
cute O
. O

the O
atmosphere B-positive
is O
noisy O
and O
the O
waiters B-positive
are O
literally O
walking O
around O
doing O
things O
as O
fast O
as O
they O
can O
. O

best O
pastrami O
i O
ever O
had O
and O
great O
portion O
without O
being O
ridiculous O
. O

the O
cypriot O
restaurant O
has O
a O
lot O
going O
for O
it O
. O

it O
is O
one O
the O
nicest O
outdoor B-positive
restaurants O
i O
have O
ever O
seen O
in O
ny--i O
am O
from O
italy O
and O
this O
place O
rivals O
the O
ones O
in O
my O
country O
. O

the O
two O
star O
chefs O
left O
quite O
some O
time O
ago O
to O
open O
their O
own O
place O

a O
cool O
bar O
with O
great O
food B-positive

tons O
of O
excellent O
beer O

she O
lives O
nearby O
but O
had O
never O
gone O
to O
this O
establishment O
thinking O
that O
it O
might O
be O
too O
touristy O
. O

the O
menu O
is O
very O
limited O
- O
i O
think O
we O
counted O
4 O
or O
5 O
entrees O
. O

in O
fact O
, O
it O
appears O
he O
is O
going O
to O
go O

at O
any O
moment O

guaranteed O
to O
be O
a O
tasty O
experience O

a O
little O

it O
really O
hits O
the O
spot B-positive
on O
a O

my O

i O
love O
this O

i O
have O
a O
but O
here O
- O
there O
was O
a O
bathroom B-negative
attendant O
in O
the O

which O
was O
odd O
. O

the O
hot B-positive
dogs I-positive
are O
good O
, O
yes O
, O
but O
the O
reason O
to O
get O
over O
here O
is O
the O
fantastic O
pork B-negative
croquette O
sandwich O
, O
perfect O
on O
its O
supermarket O
squishy O
bun O
. O

it O
was O
clear O
he O
didn O
’ O
t O
really O
care O

i O
thought O
i O
had O
died O
and O
gone O
to O
heaven O
. O

the O
food B-positive
is O
prepared O
quickly O

has O
the O
best O
chinese B-positive
style I-positive
bbq I-positive

in O
the O

i O
recommend O
it O
for O
a O
night O
when O
you O
want O
to O
splurge O
! O
( O
it O
was O
a O
bit O
expensive O
) O

we O
were O
then O
shooed O
inside O
. O

i O
never O
heard O
back O
from O
anyone O
more O
than O
a O
month O
ago O
. O

we O
got O
a O
little O
tipsy O
from O
the O
sake B-positive
but O
isn't O
that O
what O
saturday O
nights O
with O
the O

are O
all O
about O

a O

great O

in O
a O
pleasant O

in O
short O

cared O
less O
about O
our O

as O
usual O
the O
omikase O
didn't O
disappoint O
in O
freshness O
, O
although O
it O
scored O
low O
on O

i O
stumbled O
upon O
this O

when O
i O
was O
with O
two O
friends O
in O

amazing O
my O
favorite O
! O
! O
! O

i'd O
hate O
for O
tourists O
to O
go O
to O
park O
chalet O
and O
think O
that O
this O
is O
how O
all O
san O
francisco O
restaurants O
are O
like O
. O

i O
got O
hair O
in O
my O
food B-positive
2 O
times O
of O
then O
! O

great O
bagels B-positive
, O
spreads O
and O
a O

my O
six O

it O

it's O
very O
spicy O

i O
had O
filet B-positive

with I-positive
garlic I-positive

friendly O
staff B-positive
that O
actually O
lets O
you O
enjoy O
your O

the O
company O
you're O
with O
. O

the O
pizza B-positive
is O
overpriced O
and O
soggy O
. O

you O
can't O
go O
wrong O
here O
. O

i O
ended O
the O
meal B-positive
with O
the O
unusual O
dessert B-negative
of O
a O
port O
and O
chocolate O
tasting O

yummy O

but O
the O
best O
pork B-negative

the O

baluchi's O
has O
solid O
food B-positive

a O
nice O

at O
reasonable O

i O
am O

would O
not O
want O
my O
jem O
of O
a O
pizza B-positive
place I-positive
to O
become O
overcrowded O
. O

to O
be O
completely O
fair O
, O
the O
only O
redeeming O
factor O
was O
the O
food B-positive
, O
which O
was O
above O
average O
, O
but O
couldn't O
make O
up O
for O
all O
the O

of O

the O

of O

you'd O
like O
to O
take O
all O
your O

to O

still O
keep O
a O
secret O
